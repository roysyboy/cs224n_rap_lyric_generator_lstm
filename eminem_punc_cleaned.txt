look i was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
but i'm only going to get this one chance
something's wrong i can feel it
six minutes six minutes six minutes slim shady you're on
just a feeling i've got like something's about to happen but i don't know what if that means what i think it means we're in trouble big trouble and if he is as bananas as you say i'm not taking any chances
you are just what the doc ordered

i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
they said i rap like a robot so call me rapbot

but for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my pen'll go off when i halfcock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a livin' and a killin' off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
i'm an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables skillaholic kill 'em all with
this flippity dippityhippity hiphop
you don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
with this rappity brat packin' a mac in the back of the ac'
backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack
and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicin' that
i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are havin' a rough time period here's a maxi pad
it's actually disastrously bad for the wack
while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece

'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard that hard
everybody want the key and the secret
to rap immortality like i have got

well to be truthful the blueprint's
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew
mc's get taken to school with this music
'cause i use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
now i lead a new school full of students
me i'm a product of rakim
lakim shabazz 2pac nwa cube hey doc ren
yella eazy thank you they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position
to meet runâ€“dmc and induct them
into the motherfuckin' rock and roll hall of fame
even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of shame
you fags think it's all a game 'til i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'
little gaylookin' boy
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face lookin' boy
you're witnessin' a massacre
like you're watching a church gathering take place lookin' boy
oy vey that boy's gay â€“ that's all they say lookin' boy
you get a thumbs up pat on the back
and a way to go from your label every day lookin' boy
hey lookin' boy what you say lookin' boy
i get a hell yeah from dre lookin' boy
i'ma work for everything i have never ask nobody for shit
get outta my face lookin' boy
basically boy you're never gonna be capable
of keepin' up with the same pace lookin' boy 'causeâ€”

i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
the way i'm racin' around the track call me nascar nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god
kneel before general zod
this planet's krypton â€“ no asgard asgard

so you'll be thor and i'll be odin
you're rodent i'm omnipotent
let off then i'm reloadin'
immediately with these bombs i'm totin'
and i should not be woken
i'm the walkin' dead but i'm just a talkin' head a zombie floatin'
but i got your mom deepthroatin'
i'm out my ramen noodle
we have nothin' in common poodle
i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
it's me my honesty's brutal
but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes
to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case 'cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground
but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come tryin'
to censor you like that one line
i said on i'm back from the mathers lp 1 when i
tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine
put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9
see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm
morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal
you're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
you write normal fuck being normal
and i just bought a new raygun from the future
just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad
'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad
singin' to a man while they played piano
man oh man that was a 247 special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station
the very next day hey fab i'ma kill you
lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed jj fad
uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin' i'm a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman
innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating
'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated
i make elevating music you make elevator music
oh he's too mainstream
well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
it's not hiphop it's pop â€“ 'cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock shock rap with doc
throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it
i don't know how to make songs like that
i don't know what words to use
let me know when it occurs to you
while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you
how many verses i gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice
your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
ungh school flunky pill junkie
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself but still hungry
i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to
and i'm a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you
i'm drunk â€“ so satan take the fucking wheel
i'ma sleep in the front seat
bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky
but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
i have then you may be a little patient
and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then
but if i can't batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then
don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake
if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation
to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and
don't be a retard â€“ be a king think not
why be a king when you can be a god
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're tryin' to save me stop holdin' your breath
and you think i'm crazy yeah you think i'm crazy

i wanted the fame but not the cover of newsweek
oh well guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wantin' my cake and eat it too and wantin' it both ways
fame made me a balloon â€˜cause my ego inflated
when i blew see but it was confusing
â€˜cause all i wanted to do's be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink used it as a tool when i blew steam
ooh hit the lottery oohwee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winnin' a used mink
ironic â€˜cause i think i'm gettin' so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginnin' to lose sleep one sheep two sheep
going coocoo and kooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think â€˜cause i'mâ€”

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

now i ain't much of a poet
but i know somebody once told me to seize the moment
and don't squander it
â€˜cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
so i keep conjurin'
sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah ponderin' will do you wonders
no wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders
yodelodelayheehoo
i think it went wanderin' off down yonder
and stumbled onto jeff vanvonderen
â€˜cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
â€˜cause the very thing that i love's killing me
and i can't conquer it
my ocd is conkin' me in the head keep knockin'
nobody's home i'm sleepwalkin'
i'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
don't shoot the messenger i'm just friends with theâ€”

call me crazy but i have this vision
one day that i'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and
i'm comin' straight at mc's blood gets spilled and
i'll take it back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that pumpedup feelin'
and shit to say back to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fuckin' children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are going through a struggle feels it
and relates that's great it's payback russell wilson
falling way back in the draft
turn nothin' into somethin' still can
make that straw into gold chump i will spin

look if you had one shot or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
would you capture it or just let it slip

yo his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti
he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words won't come out
he's choking how everybody's joking now
the clock's run out time's up overâ€”blaow
snap back to reality oh there goes gravity oh
there goes rabbit he choked he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy no he won't have it he knows
his whole back's to these ropes it don't matter he's dope
he knows that but he's broke he's so stagnant he knows
when he goes back to this mobile home that's when it's
back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you betterâ€¦

his soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking make me king
as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring but superstardom's
close to postmortem it only grows harder
homie grows hotter he blows it's all over
these hoes is all on him coasttocoast shows
he's known as the globetrotter lonely roads
god only knows he's grown farther from home he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
these hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nosedove and sold nada and so the soap opera
is told it unfolds i suppose it's old partner
but the beat goes on dadadom dadom dahdah dahdah

you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you betterâ€¦

no more games i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin' in the beginning the mood all changed
i've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i can't get by with my nineto
five and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
'cause man these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
and there's no movie there's no mekhi phifer this is my life
and these times are so hard and it's gettin' even harder
tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter
caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama screamin' on her too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot another day of monotony's
gotten me to the point i'm like a snail i've got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin' optionâ€”failure's not
mom i love you but this trailer's got
to go i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go it's my shot feet fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got

you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you betterâ€¦

'cause she loves danger psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's girl even i know that

i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
i walk on water
but only when it freezes fuck

why are expectations so high is it the bar i set
my arms i stretch but i canâ€™t reach
a far cry from it or it's in my grasp but as
soon as i grab squeeze
i lose my grip like the flying trapeze
into the dark i plummet now the sky's blackening
i know the markâ€™s high butterâ€“
flies rip apart my stomach
knowin' that no matter what bars i come with
you're gonna harp gripe and
that's a hard vicodin to swallow so i scrap these
as pressure increases like khakis
i feel the ice cracking becauseâ€”

i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
it's the curse of theâ€” it's the curse of theâ€”
i walk on water shit
but only when it freezes

it's the curse of the standard
that the first of the mathers discs set
always in search of the verse that i havenâ€™t spit yet
will this step just be another misstep
to tarnish whatever the legacy love or respect
iâ€™ve garnered the rhyme has to be perfect the delivery flawless
and it always feels like i'm hittinâ€™ the mark
'til i go sit in the car listen and pick it apart
like this shit is garbage
god's given me all this still i feel no different regardless
kids look to me as a god this is retarded
if only they knew it's a facade and itâ€™s exhaustive
and i try not to listen to nonsense
but if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
mission accomplished
i'm not godsent nas rakim 'pac big james todd smith
and i'm not prince soâ€¦

i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
i walk on water
it's true i'm a rubik'sâ€” it's trueâ€”
but only when it freezes
it's trueâ€”

'cause i'm only human just like you
making my mistakes oh if you only knew
i don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'cause i'm terrified to let you down oh

it's true i'm a rubik'sâ€”a beautiful mess
at times juvenile yes i goof and i jest
a flawed human i guess
but i'm doin' my best to not ruin your exâ€“
pectations and meet 'em but first
the speedom verse now big sean
he's goin' too fast is he gonna shout or curse out his mom
there was a time i had the world by the balls eatin' out my palm
every album song i was spazzin' the fuck out on
and now i'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
but the only one who's looking down on
me that matters now's deshaun
am i lucky to be around this long
begs the question though
especially after the methadone
as yesterday fades and the dresden home
is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
the crowds are gone
and it's time to wash out the blonde
sales decline the curtain's drawn
they're closin' the set i'm still pokin' my head from out behind
and everyone who has doubt remind
now take your best rhyme outdo it now do it a thousand times
now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
or gives a fuck about your rhymes
and as i grow outta site outta mind i might go outta mine
'cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight
when i made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine
but when i do fall from these heights though i'll be fine
i won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
but i'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'causeâ€”

i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
i walk on water
but only when it freezes

'cause i'm only human just like you
i've been making my mistakes oh if you only knew
i don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'cause i'm terrified to let you down oh
if i walked on water i would drown

'cause i'm just a man
but as long as i got a mic i'm godlike
so me and you are not alike
bitch i wrote stan
part 1 produced by s1 and mphazes

it's like i'm in this dirt digging up old hurt
tried everything to get my mind off you it won't work
all it takes is one song on the radio you're
right back on it reminding me all over again
how you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
maybe i needed to grow up a little first
well looks like i hit a growth spurt
but i'm coming for closure
don't suppose an explanation i'm owed for
the way that you turned your back on me
just when i may have needed you most
oh you thought it was over you could just close the
chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
you ruined mine but you seem to be doin' fine
well i've never recovered
but tonight i bet you that what you're
'bout to go through's tougher than anything i ever have suffered
can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
can i hold grudges mind saying let it go fuck this
heart's saying i will once i bury this bitch alive
hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset

i flee the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through
oh you had me pegged the first time
you can see the truth but it's easier to justify
what's bad is good and i hate to be the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy
follow me i ruhuhun follow me i ruhuhun
i just hate to be the bad guy
follow me i ruhuhun follow me i ruhuhun

and to think i used to think you was the shit bitch
to think it was you at one time i worshipped shit
think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch
finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew nitwit
thought some time would pass and i'd forget it forget it
you left our family in shambles
and you expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
may be gone but he's not forgotten
and don't think â€˜cause he's been out the pictures
so long that i've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
you're wrong and that shit was rotten
and the way you played him same shit you did to me cold
have you any idea the shit that i've gone through
feelings i harbor all this pentup resentment i hold on to
not once you call to ask me how i'm doin'
letters you don't respond to 'em
fuck it i'm coming to see you
and gee who better to talk to than you
the cause of my problems
my life is garbage and i'm 'bout to take it out on you
poof then i'm gone voosh

i flee the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through
oh you had me pegged the first time
you can see the truth but it's easier to justify
what's bad is good and i hate to be the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy
follow me i ruhuhun follow me i ruhuhun
i just hate to be the bad guy
follow me i ruhuhun follow me i ruhuhun

i've been drivin' around your side of this town
like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
finally i found your new address park in your drive
feel like i've been waiting on this moment all of my life
and it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
my knife is out and i'm ducking on the side of your house
see it's sad it came to this point
such a disappointment i had to make this appointment
to come and see ya but i ain't here for your empathy
i don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
it's revenge that i seek
so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
like i reached my full potential i peeked
continue to peep still bent low then keep
tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak
all the way 'round to the back porch
man door handles unlocked shouldn't be that easy to do this
you don't plan for intruders beforehand
surprised to see me cat caught your tongue
gag chloroform rag gag almost hackup a lung
like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan
dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
irony's spectacular huh now who's a faggot you punk
and here's your bronco hat
you can have that shit back â€˜cause they suck
it's just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it
we're in the car right now â€“ wait here comes my favorite lyric
i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
and hey here's a sequel to my
mathers lp just to try to get people to buy
how's this for a publicity stunt this should be fun
last album now â€˜cause after this you'll be officially done
eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell
bitch i even have your initials
i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
since you're in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck
the best place you could be buried alive is right here
two more exits time is quite near
hope we don't get stopped no license i fear
that sirens i hear guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
oh god police aaaghh
hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
new plan stan
slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car
well gotta go almost at the bridge
ha ha big bro it's for you slim this is for him
and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good
now say you hate homos again
part 2 produced by streetrunner

i also represent
anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
i'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
i'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
nope it's hopeless i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
when they say all of this is approachin' its end
but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again
back's to the wall i'm stacking up all them odds
toilets clogged yeah â€˜cause i'm talking a lot of
shit but i'm backing it all up
but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience
i'm the ringing in your ears
i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
grab for some water
but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
i'm the bullies you hate that you became
with every faggot you slaughtered
coming back on you every woman you insult
batter but the doublestandards you have
when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted
â€˜cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona
is half a facade and matthew and stan's just symbolic
of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
â€˜cause after all the glitz and the glam
no more fans that are calling your name
cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
i'm the hindsight to say â€œi told you soâ€
foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
if you don't stop after they call ya
biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
when it's time to walk away i'm every guilt trip
the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions
if there's anything you have left to say
'less it makes an impact then don't bother
so 'fore you rest your case
better make sure you're packin' a wallop
so one last time i'm back
before it fades into black and it's all over
behold the final chapter in a saga
tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
twice the magic that started
it all tragic portrait of an artist
tortured trapped in his own drawings
tap into thoughts blacker and darker
than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark
as we pick up where the last mathers left off
my tea's gone cold
i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad

dear slim i wrote you but you still ain't callin'
i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn you must not've got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways fuck it what's been up man how's your daughter
my girlfriend's pregnant too i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter guess what i'ma call her
i'ma name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie too i'm sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this every day but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
i like the shit you did with rawkus too that shit was fat
anyways i hope you get this man hit me back
just to chat truly yours your biggest fan this is stan

my tea's gone cold
i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad

dear slim you still ain't called or wrote i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert
you didn't have to
but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother man he's only six years old
we waited in the blisterin' cold
for you for four hours and you just said no
that's pretty shitty man you're like his fuckin' idol
he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do
i ain't that mad though i just don't like being lied to
remember when we met in denver
you said if i'd write you you would write back
see i'm just like you in a way i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
so when i have a shitty day i drift away and put 'em on
â€˜cause i don't really got shit else
so that shit helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real and i respect you â€˜cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous â€˜cause i talk about you 247
but she don't know you like i know you slim no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me man
i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose sincerely yours stan
ps we should be together too

my tea's gone cold
i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad

dear mr i'mtoogoodtocallorwritemyfans
this'll be the last package i ever send your ass
it's been six months and still no word â€” i don't deserve it
i know you got my last two letters
i wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
so this is my cassette i'm sendin' you i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now i'm doin' 90 on the freeway
hey slim i drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive
you know the song by phil collins in the air of the night
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
but didn't then phil saw it all then at a show he found him
that's kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drownin'
now it's too late i'm on a thousand downers now i'm drowsy
and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i loved you slim we coulda been together â€” think about it
you ruined it now i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream i hope you can't sleep
and you scream about it i hope your conscience eats at you
and you can't breathe without me
see slimâ€” shut up bitch i'm tryin' to talk
hey slim that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
but i didn't slit her throat i just tied her up see i ain't like you
â€˜cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
well gotta go i'm almost at the bridge now
oh shit i forgot how am i supposed to send this shit out

my tea's gone cold
i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad

dear stan i meant to write you sooner but i just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now how far along is she
look i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph
for your brother i wrote it on a starter cap
i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show i musta missed you
don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you
but what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
i say that shit just clownin' dawg come on how fucked up is you
you got some issues stan i think you need some counselin'
to help your ass from bouncin'
off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be together
that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter
i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself i think that you'll be doin' just fine
if you relax a little i'm glad i inspire you but stan
why are you so mad try to understand
that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy shit
i seen this one shit on the news
a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk
and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to
come to think about it his name wasâ€¦ it was you damn
obie trice real name no gimmicks â€“ record scratch

two trailer park girls go 'round the outside

well if you want shady this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
than a shock when i get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when i'm not cooperating
when i'm rocking the table while he's operating heyyy
you waited this long now stop debating
â€˜cause i'm back i'm on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job ms cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating
so the fcc won't let me be
or let me be me so let me see
they try to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me
so come on and dip bum on your lips
fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits
and get ready â€˜cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuitsâ€”fuck you debbie

â€˜cause we need a little controversy
â€˜cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me

little hellions kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
a visionary vision is scary
could start a revolution polluting the airwaves
a rebel so just let me revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissing my ass â€‹â€‹smackâ€‹â€‹
and it's a disaster such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my assâ€”you asked for me
well i'm back nananananananananana
fix your bent antenna tune it in and then i'm gonna
enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention back for the winter
i'm interesting the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
testing attention please
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my ten cents my two cents is free
a nuisance who sent you sent for me

now this looks like a job for me
so everybody just follow me
â€˜cause we need a little controversy
â€˜cause it feels so empty without me

a tiskit a taskit i'll go tit for tat with
anybody who's talking this shit that shit
chris kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked

you don't know me you're too old let go
it's over nobody listens to techno
now let's go just give me the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i been dope suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol
but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm disgusting
but it's just me i'm just obscene
no i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy
hey there's a concept that works
twenty million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'll be so empty without me

now this looks like a job for me

kids
may i have your attention please
may i have your attention please
will the real slim shady please stand up
i repeat will the real slim shady please stand up
we're gonna have a problem here

y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam like tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
they first were divorced throwin' her over furniture agh
it's the return of the ah wait no way you're kidding
he didn't just say what i think he did did he
and dr dre saidâ€¦ nothing you idiots
dr dre's dead he's locked in my basement ha ha
feminist women love eminem
chicka chicka chicka slim shady i'm sick of him
look at him walkin' around grabbin' his youknowwhat
flippin' the youknowwho yeah but he's so cute though
yeah i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose
but can't but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
and if i'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they've got the discovery channel don't they
we ain't nothin' but mammalsâ€”well some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote
women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goesâ€”

i'm slim shady yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up please stand up
'cause i'm slim shady yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up please stand up

will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
well i do so fuck him and fuck you too
you think i give a damn about a grammy
half of you critics can't even stomach me let alone stand me
but slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird
why so you guys could just lie to get me here
so you can sit me here next to britney spears
shit christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch put me on blast on mtv
yeah he's cute but i think he's married to kim heehee
i should download her audio on mp3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
all you do is annoy me so i have been sent here to destroy you
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me who just don't give a fuck like me

so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up please stand up

i'm like a head trip to listen to â€˜cause i'm only givin' you
things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it i just shit it
better than 90 of you rappers out can
then you wonder how can
kids eat up these albums like valiums
it's funny â€˜cause at the rate i'm going when i'm 30
i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurse's asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurking
he could be working at burger king spittin' on your onion rings
or in the parking lot circling screaming i don't give a fuck
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time loud as you can how does it go

i'm slim shady yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up please stand up
'cause i'm slim shady yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up

fuck it letâ€™s all stand up
this is survival of the fittest
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all aall aall aall

wasn't ready to be no millionaire i was illprepared
i was prepared to be ill though the skill was there
from the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends
it was 'bout bustin' raps
and standin' for somethin' fuckin' acronym
cut the fuckin' act like you're happy i'm fuckin' back again
with another anthem â€“ why stop when it doesn't have to end
it ain't over 'til i say it's over enough when i say enough
throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
i'm afraid of what will happen to them wolves
when the thought of being thrown
into an alligator pit i salivate at it wait is up
hands up like it's 12 noon
nah homie hold them bitches straighter up
wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
came up rough came to ruffle feathers
nah egos i ain't deflate enough
last chance to make this whole stadium erupt â€˜causeâ€”

this is survival of the fittest
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all aall aall aall

i can see the finish line with each line that i finish
i'm so close to my goals i can almost pole vault over the goal post
and if i don't got enough in the tank
maybe i can just siphon enough
to fill up this last can man will i survive in this climate or what
they said i was washedup and got a bloodbath
i'm not a rapper i'm an adapter i can adjust
plus i can just walk up to a mic and just bust
so floor's open if you'd like to discuss
top 5 in this muh'fucka and if i don't make the cut
what like i give a fuck
but i light this bitch up like i'm driving a truck
through the side of a pump 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
like gunit without the hyphen i'm hyping 'em up
and if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
and i look like i might just give up eh might've mistook
me for bowin' out i ain't takin' a bow
i'm stabbin' myself with a fuckin' knife in the gut
while i'm wipin' my butt
â€˜cause i just shitted on the mic and i like gettin' cut
i get excited at the sight of my blood
you're in a fight with a nut
â€˜cause i'ma fight 'til i die or win bitin' the dust
it'll just make me angrier wait let me remind you of what
got me this far picture me quittin'
now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
it's survival of what

this is survival of the fittest
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all aall aall aall
so take it all aall aall aall

so get your ideas stack your ammo
but don't come unless you come to battle
now mount up jump in the saddle
this is itâ€”it's what you eat sleep piss and shit
live breathe your whole existence just consists of this
refuse to quit fuse is lit can't defuse the wick
if i don't do this music shit i'll lose my shit
ain't got shit to lose it's the moment of truth
it's all i know how to do as soon as i get thrown in a booth i spit
but my respect is overdue
i'm showin' you the flow no one do
â€˜cause i don't own no diploma for school i quit
so there's nothin' for me to fall back on i know no other trade
so you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some toolboxes
â€˜cause you'll never take my pride from me
it'll have to be pried from me
so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
but i want you to doubt me i don't want you to buhlieve
â€˜cause this is somethin' that i must use to succeed
and if you don't like me then fuck you selfesteem
must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof â€˜cause trust me
my skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
i can see why the fuck i disgust you i must be
allergic to failure â€˜cause everytime i come close to it
i just sneeze but i just go achoo then achieve

this is survival of the fittest
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all aall aall aall
mom i know i let you down
and though you say the days are happy
why is the power off and i'm fucked up
and mom i know he's not around
but don't you place the blame on me
as you pour yourself another drink yeah

i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far

i went in headfirst never thinkin' about who what i said hurt
in what verse my mom probably got it the worst
the brunt of it but as stubborn as we are did i take it too far
cleanin' out my closet and all them other songs
but regardless i don't hate you â€˜cause ma
you're still beautiful to me â€˜cause you're my mom
though far be it from you to be calm
our house was vietnam desert storm
and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
equivalent to chemical warfare
and forever we could drag this on and on
but agree to disagree that gift for me
up under the christmas tree don't mean shit to me
you're kickin' me out it's 15 degrees
and it's christmas eve little prick just leave
ma let me grab my fucking coat
anything to have each other's goats
why we always at each other's throats
especially when dad he fucked us both
we're in the same fuckin' boat
you'd think that'd make us close nope
further away it drove us but together headlights shine
and a car full of belongings still got a ways to go
back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
and i was the man of the house the oldest
so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
then nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
and that's when i realized you were sick
and it wasn't fixable or changeable
and to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though butâ€”

i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far

â€˜cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though
â€˜cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
but i'm sorry momma for cleanin' out my closet
at the time i was angry rightfully maybe so
never meant that far to take it though
â€˜cause now i know it's not your fault and i'm not makin' jokes
that song i no longer play at shows
and i cringe every time it's on the radio
and i think of nathan being placed in a home
and all the medicine you fed us and
how i just wanted you to taste your own
but now the medication's takin' over
and your mental state's deterioratin' slow
and i'm way too old to cry the shit is painful though
but ma i forgive you so does nathan yo
all you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
but i love you debbie mathers
oh what a tangled web we have â€˜cause
one thing i never asked was
where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
fuck it i guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
but i'da flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
owned a collection of maps
and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
if someone ever moved 'em from me
that you coulda bet your asses
if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa kidnap 'em
and although one has only met their grandma once
you pulled up in our drive one night
as we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
me her and nate we introduced you hugged you
and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness
come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
i saw your headlights as i looked back
and i'm mad i didn't get the chance to
thank you for being my mom and my dad
so mom please accept this as a
tribute i wrote this on the jet i guess i had to
get this off my chest i hope i get the chance to
lay it 'fore i'm dead the stewardess said to fasten
my seatbelt i guess we're crashin'
so if i'm not dreamin' i hope you get this message that
i will always love you from afar â€˜cause you're my mom

i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far

i want a new life start over
one without a cause clean slate
so i'm coming home tonight
well no matter what the cost
and if the plane goes down
or if the crew can't wake me up
well just know that i'm alright
i was not afraid to die
oh even if there's songs to sing
well my children will carry me
just know that i'm alright
i was not afraid to die
because i put my faith in my little girls
so i never say goodbye cruel world
just know that i'm alright
i am not afraid to die

i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far
i want a new life
'cause sometimes you just feel tired feel weak yo left yo left yo left right left
and when you feel weak yo left
you feel like you wanna just give up yo left yo left
but you gotta search within you right left
tryna find that inner strength yo left yo left
and just pull that shit out of you yo left
and get that motivation to not give up right left yo left
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall yo left yo left
flat on your face and collapse right left

'til i collapse i'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'til the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killin' 'em
â€˜cause when i am not then i'ma stop pennin' 'em
and i am not hiphop and i'm just not eminem
subliminal thoughts when i'ma stop sendin' 'em
women are caught in webs spin 'em and hock venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
amoxicillin's just not real enough
the criminal copkillin' hiphop villain
a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
you're comin' with me feel it or not
you're gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot lyrics to shock
is it a miracle or am i just product of pop fizzin' up
fa shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up
you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck

'til the roof comes off 'til the lights go out
'til my legs give out can't shut my mouth
'til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps
i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
until the roof 'til the roof comes off 'til the lights go out
the roof comes off 'til my legs give out can't shut my mouth
until my legs 'til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps
give out from underneath me i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

music is like magic there's a certain feelin' you get
when you real and you spit and people are feelin' your shit
this is your moment and every single minute you spend
tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
so while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'cause i'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
i got a list here's the order of my list that it's in
it goes reggie jayz 2pac and biggie
andrã© from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me
but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of envy
so when i'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
that's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
you hate it but you know respect you got to give me
the press's wet dream like bobby and whitney â€” nate hit me

'til the roof comes off 'til the lights go out
'til my legs give out can't shut my mouth
'til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps
i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
until the roof 'til the roof comes off 'til the lights go out
the roof comes off 'til my legs give out can't shut my mouth
until my legs 'til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps
give out from underneath me i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

soon as a verse starts i eat at an mc's heart
what is he thinking how not to go against me smart
and it's absurd how people hang on every word
i'll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
â€˜cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin' could ever be worse
that's why i'm clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic i act like i'm an addict
i rap like i'm addicted to smack like i'm kim mathers
but i don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a fullblown attack i'm launchin' at 'em
the track is on some battlin' raps who wants some static
â€˜cause i don't really think that the fact that i'm slim matters
a plaque and platinum status is whack if i'm not the baddest so

'til the roof comes off 'til the lights go out
'til my legs give out can't shut my mouth
'til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps
i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
until the roof 'til the roof comes off 'til the lights go out
the roof comes off 'til my legs give out can't shut my mouth
until my legs 'til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps
give out from underneath me i'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

until the roof until the roof
the roof comes off the roof comes off
until my legs until my legs
give out from underneath me
i will not fall i will stand tall
feels like no one can beat me
now everybody from the threeonethree
put your motherfucking hands up and follow me
everybody from the threeonethree
put your motherfucking hands up look look
now while he stands tough
notice that this man did not have his hands up
this free world's got you gassed up
now who's afraid of the big bad wolf
one two three and to the four
one pac two pac three pac four
four pac three pac two pac one
you're pac he's pac no pac none
this guy ain't no motherfucking mc
i know everything he's 'bout to say against me
i am white i am a fucking bum
i do live in a trailer with my mom
my boy future is an uncle tom
i do got a dumb friend named cheddar bob
who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
i did get jumped by all six of you chumps
and wink did fuck my girl
i'm still standing here screaming fuck the free world
don't ever try to judge me dude
you don't know what the fuck i've been through
but i know something about you
you went to cranbrook that's a private school
what's the matter dawg you embarrassed
this guy's a gangster his real name's clarence
and clarence lives at home with both parents
and clarence parents have a real good marriage
this guy don't wanna battle he's shook
'cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
he's scared to death he's scared to look
at his fucking yearbook fuck cranbrook
fuck the beat i'll go a cappella
fuck a papa doc fuck a clock fuck a trailer
fuck everybody fuck y'all if you doubt me
i'm a piece of fucking white trash i say it proudly
and fuck this battle i don't wanna win i'm outtie
here tell these people something they don't know about me
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well that's all right
because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well that's all right
because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

i can't tell you what it really is
i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight
high off her love drunk from her hate
it's like i'm huffin' paint
and i love her the more i suffer i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown she resuscitates me
she fuckin' hates me and i love it â€œwait
where you goingâ€ â€œi'm leaving youâ€ â€œno you ain't
come backâ€ we're runnin' right back here we go again
it's so insane 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great
i'm superman with the wind at his back she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful i feel so ashamed
i snap â€œwho's that dudeâ€ i don't even know his name
i laid hands on him i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well that's all right
because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well that's all right
because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

you ever love somebody so much
you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin'
yeah them chills used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
you swore you'd never hit 'em never do nothin' to hurt 'em
now you're in each other's face
spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push pull each other's hair scratch claw bit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em
so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that took over it controls you both
so they say it's best to go your separate ways
guess that they don't know ya
'cause today that was yesterday yesterday is over
it's a different day sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her next time you'd show restraint
you don't get another chance life is no nintendo game
but you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well that's all right
because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well that's all right
because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

now i know we said things did things that we didn't mean
and we fall back into the same patterns same routines
but your temper's just as bad as mine is
you're the same as me when it comes to love
you're just as blinded baby please
come back it wasn't you baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed i'll aim my fist at the drywall
next time there won't be no next time
i apologize even though i know it's lies
i'm tired of the games i just want her back
i know i'm a liar if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
i'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well that's all right
because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well that's all right
because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
something's burning i can't figure out what out what
it's either lust or a cloud of dust
judgement is clouded must
just be the powder from the power of love
but i'm in something i don't know how to get out of
left my girl in the house alone
is that my soontobespouseâ€™s moan
and the further i walk the louder
pause for a minute to make certain that's what i heard
â€˜cause after all this is her place
so i give her the benefit of the doubt i
think i might be about to bust her bust her
the thought's scary yo though and it hurts â€“ brace
hope it ain't here we go yo
â€˜cause my head already goes to worstcase
scenario though in the first place
but you confirmed my low end theory though
shoulda known when i made it all the way to third base
and that was only the first date
coulda made it to home plate
but you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
no slurp you don't slurp under slurp stand
i slurp don't slurp do this for anyone ever
yeah that ain't what they all say
i'll say you can suck a softball through a straw
used to be my fiancã©
'til you sucked on wayne andrã© and kanye
lebron akon jay lil jon raekwon mae
polow tha don dre dante ross james conway kwame
guess i'm gettin' my ggoddang jigga on eh
â€˜cause your name i'm beyond sayin'
but fuck it i'm movin' on you women are all cray
but i'll probably always keep on playin'â€”

the game of love love love love
lalalalala love

she doesn't love me no she don't love me no more
she hates my company yeah she don't love me no more
i tried to get her up out of my head left my bags at the door
she screamed she loved me like she never did before
and i told her go where you wanna go

i'm in the mirror with this look on my face curious
why you ain't fuckin' with me you cut me deep as a caesarean
you know i want you bad as a benjamin i'm delirious
i want you bad as the head shattered on george zimmerman
after the dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
his mouthpiece for a cadillac emblem
that's analogy and metaphor for you
i should win a medal for all the ways i adore you
this is me talkin' cordial yeah i got some home trainin'
that ain't what you like ain't it
what about if i was as famous as marshall
would you give fellatio in the carpool
cops pull us over they just wanna know if you gargle
singing i hope she's good enough
meanwhile you're chasin' her
chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
pity the fool and pity the fool in me i'ma live with theâ€”

the game of love love love love
lalalalala love

she doesn't love me no she don't love me no more
she hates my company yeah she don't love me no more
i tried to get her up out of my head left my bags at the door
she screamed she loved me like she never did before
and i told her go where you wanna go
go do whatcha want to do â€“ i don't care
and i told her go where you wanna go
go do whatcha want to do â€“ i don't care

so needless to say i'm feelin' betrayed
snatch my house key off her key chain
she jumps off weebey from the wire's dick
now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
here goes that broken record clichã©
it's all my fault anyway she's turning the tables i'm a beatbreak
she treats my face like serato she cuts and scratches like a dj
each day is an instant replay
they say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
back together but forgot today was her bday
she cut me off on the freeway
simple misunderstanding but just as i went to slam on the brakes
that's when i realized that she may be as crazy as me wait
bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
stepped on them fuckers eight times
still goin' 73 thank god there's an exit comin' up
what the mother fuck's wrong with her
hit the off ramp 'til i coasted to a goddamn halt
hit a fuckin' tree now here she comes at full speed
she's racing at me okay you wanna fuck with me eh
snatch the bitch out her car through the window
she screamin' i body slam her on the cement
until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
buried this stink ho in it then pay to have the street repaved
the fuck woke up in a dream state
in a cold sweat like i got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
guess i eventually caved though â€˜cause she's laying next to me in bed â€“ directly aiming a gat at my head
woke up again and jumped up
like fuck it i've had it i'm checkin' into rehab
i confess i'm a static addict i guess that's why i'm so clingy
every girl i've ever had either says i got too much baggage
or i'm too fuckin' dramatic
man what the fuck is the matter i'm just a fuckin' romantic
i fuckin' love you you fuckin' bitch
combative possessive in fact last time i was mad at an ex
i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
i said hit the road and after she left
i sent that bitch a text i said be careful driving
don't read this and have an accident
she glanced to look at it and wrecked
too bad thought we had a connect
no sense dwelling makes never been a more compelling case
than the model covered in l'oreal and mace
who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
while the whore was yelling rape
'til her vocal cords were swelling
and her voice were more hoarser than tori spellings' face
still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates
to greet norman bates with a warm embrace
unless you're andrea yates don't ask me for a date
don't be late well the sentiment's great
but wait think there's been a mistake
you wanted an intimate date i wanna intimidate
i have infinite hate in my blood
it's mainly because of the game ofâ€” message sound

yeah i know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now but hey what'd daddy always tell you straighten up little soldier stiffen up that upper lip what you cryin' about you got me

hailie i know you miss your mom and i know you miss your dad
when i'm gone but i'm tryin' to give you the life that i never had
i can see you're sad even when you smile even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes deep inside you wanna cry
'cause you're scared i ain't there
daddy's with you in your prayers
no more crying wipe them tears
daddy's here no more nightmares
we gon' pull together through it
we gon' do it lainieâ€”uncle's crazy ain't he
yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
we're all we got in this world when it spins when it swirls
when it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls
looking puzzled in a daze i know it's confusing you
daddy's always on the move momma's always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that the more it backfires on me
all the things growing up as daddy that he had to see
daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us i don't see us ever being
together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be but it's just something
we have no control over and that's what destiny is
but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

now hush little baby don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy pretty baby
but i promise momma's gon' be alright
heh it's funny

i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em were from me 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night cryin'
'cause daddy felt like a bumâ€”see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in
either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
and it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
mom and dad was arguing a lot so momma moved back
on to chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me
but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
then you started seein' daddy on the tv and momma didn't like it
and you and lainie were too young to understand it
papa was a rolling stone momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i'm sittin' in this empty house
just reminiscin' lookin' at your baby pictures it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown it's almost like you're sisters now
wow guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
lainie i'm talking to you too daddy's still here
i like the sound of that yeah it's got a ring to it don't it
sshh momma's only gone for the moment

now hush little baby don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy pretty baby
but i promise momma's gon' be alright

and if you ask me to daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
i'ma give you the world
i'ma buy a diamond ring for you i'ma sing for you
i'll do anything for you to see you smile
and if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
i'ma break that birdie's neck
i'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
and make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad haha
lately i've been hard to reach
i've been too long on my own
everybody has a private world
where they can be alone
are you calling me
are you trying to get through
are you reaching out for me
then i'm reaching out for you

i'm just so fuckin' depressed
i just can't seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump
but i need somethin' to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises took my lumps
fell down and i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up
in order for me to pick the mic back up
i don't know how or why or when
i ended up in this position i'm in
i'm starting to feel distant again
so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent
but i just can't admit or come to grips with the fact
that i may be done with rap i need a new outlet
and i know some shit's so hard to swallow
but i just can't sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow but i know one fact
i'll be one tough act to follow one tough act to follow
i'll be one tough act to follow
here today gone tomorrow
but you'd have to walk a thousand milesâ€”

in my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
i'll be you let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes
but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you

i think i'm starting to lose my sense of humor
everything's so tense and gloom
i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature
of the room just as soon as
i walk in it's like all eyes on me
so i try to avoid any eye contact
â€˜cause if i do that then it opens a door
for conversation like i want that
i'm not lookin' for extra attention
i just wanna be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i don't need no fuckin' manservant
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack
and half of 'em ain't even funny like ha
marshall you're so funny man
you should be a comedian goddamn
unfortunately i am
i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why don't you all sit down
listen to the tale i'm about to tell
hell we don't gotta trade our shoes
and you ain't gotta walk no thousand milesâ€”

in my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
i'll be you let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes
but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you

nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands we're dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves
and flip 'em don't expect no help
now i could've either just sat on my ass
and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which i'm placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid
to wait by the door and pack his bags
and sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in in every single place
every school i went i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it meant acting stupid
aunt edna always told me
keep making that face it'll get stuck like that
meanwhile i'm just standin' there
holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
'til i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
at eight years old i learned my lesson then
â€˜cause i wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
â€˜cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
it's probably 110 different
i guess we would have to walk a mile
in each other's shoes at least
what size you wear i wear 10's
let's see if you can fit your feetâ€”

in my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
i'll be you let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes
but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you

lately i've been hard to reach
i've been too long on my own
everybody has a private world
where they can be alone
are you calling me
are you trying to get through
are you reaching out for me
then i'm reaching out for you

yeah to my babies stay strong
daddy'll be home soon
and to the rest of the world
god gave you them shoes to fit you
so put 'em on and wear 'em
be yourself man be proud of who you are
even if it sounds corny
never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful
tell me where to go
tell me what to do
i'll be right there for you
tell me what to say
no matter if it's true
i'll say it all for you

i used to be the type of kid
that would always think the sky is fallin'
why am i so differently wired am i a martian
what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in
â€˜cause i don't belong in this world
that's why i'm scoffin' at authority defiant often
flyin' off at the handle at my mom
no dad so i am noncompliant at home
at school i'm just shy and awkward
and i don't need no goddamn psychologist
tryin' to diagnose why i have all these underlyin' problems
thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
i'm outside chalkin' up drawings
on the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
to myself either that or inside hidin' off in
the corner somewhere quiet tryin' not to
be noticed â€˜cause i'm cryin' and sobbin'
i had a bad day at school so i ain't talkin'
some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
â€˜cause he said that i eyeballed him

and if you fall i'll catch you there
i'll be your savior from all the wars
that are fought inside your world
please have faith in my words

â€˜cause this is my legacy legacy yeah
this is my legacy legacy yeah
there's no guarantee
it's not up to me we can only see
this is my legacy legacy legacy legacy

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
why am i so differently wired in my noggin
â€˜cause sporadic as my thoughts come it's mindbogglin'
â€˜cause i obsess on everything in my mind small shit
bothers me but not my father he said sayonara
then split but i donâ€™t give a shit
i'm fine long as there's batteries in my walkman
nothing is the matter with me
shit look on the bright side at least i ain't walkin'
i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a tenspeed which i've acquired parts that
i find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it
headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
but if this is all there is for me life offers
why bother even tryin' to put up a fight it's nonsense
but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
what about them rhymes i've been jottin'
they are kind of giving me confidence
instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
why don't i just blast a little something like onyx
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what i want to say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him
grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
who woulda knew from the moment i turned the mic on that
i could be iconic in my conquest
that's word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest

this is my legacy legacy yeah
this is my legacy legacy yeah
there's no guarantee
it's not up to me we can only see
this is my legacy legacy legacy legacy

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
now i think the fact that i'm differently wired's awesome
â€˜cause if i wasn't i wouldn't be able to work words like this
and connect lines like crosswords
and use my enemy's words as strength
to try and draw from and get inspired off 'em
â€˜cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit
by you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
now you shut up bitch i am talkin'
thought i was full of horseshit
and now you fuckin' worship the ground on which i am walkin'
me against the world so what i'm brian dawkins
versus the whole 016 lions offense
so bring on the giants falcons and miami dolphins
it's the body bag game bitch i'm supplyin' coffins
â€˜cause you dicks butt kiss bunch of brian baldingers
you're gon' die a ball licker i've been diabolical
with this dialogue since '99 rawkus
you don't respect the legacy i leave behind y'all can
suck a dick the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
in a flying saucer full of italian sausage
the most high exaltin' and i ain't haltin'
'til i die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
the best part about me is i am not you
i'm me and i'm the fire marshall and this is myâ€”

this is my legacy legacy yeah
this is my legacy legacy yeah
there's no guarantee
it's not up to me we can only see
this is my legacy legacy legacy legacy
yeah it's been a ride i guess i had to go to that place to get to this one now some of you might still be in that place if you're tryin' to get out just follow me i'll get you there

you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay 'em
but you won't take the sting out these words before i say 'em
'cause ain't no way i'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
when i say i'ma do somethin' i do it
i don't give a damn what you think i'm doin' this for me
so fuck the world feed it beans it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
i'ma be what i set out to be without a doubt undoubtably
and all those who look down on me i'm tearin' down your balcony
no ifs ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
from infinite down to the last relapse album he's still shittin'
whether he's on salary paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
whichever comes first for better or worse
he's married to the game like a fuck you for christmas
his gift is a curse
forget the earth he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
and fuck the whole universe

iâ€™m not afraid iâ€™m not afraid
to take a stand to take a stand
everybody everybody
come take my hand come take my hand
weâ€™ll walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just lettin' you know that youâ€™re not alone
holla if you feel like youâ€™ve been down the same road

okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
i shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
for you to know it's a wrap
you said you was king you lied through your teeth
for that fuck your feelings
instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped
and to the fans i'll never let you down again i'm back
i promise to never go back on that promise
in fact let's be honest that last relapse cd wasâ€”ehh
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground
relax i ain't goin' back to that now
all i'm tryin' to say is get back clickclackblaow
'cause i ain't playin' around
there's a game called circle and i don't know how
i'm way too up to back down
but i think i'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out but i guess i didn't
this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
but it's time to exorcise these demons
these muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

iâ€™m not afraid iâ€™m not afraid
to take a stand to take a stand
everybody everybody
come take my hand come take my hand
weâ€™ll walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just lettin' you know that youâ€™re not alone
holla if you feel like youâ€™ve been down the same road

and i just canâ€™t keep livin' this way
so startin' today
iâ€™m breakin' out of this cage
iâ€™m standin' up i'ma face my demons
iâ€™m mannin' up i'ma hold my ground
iâ€™ve had enough now iâ€™m so fed up
time to put my life back together right now

it was my decision to get clean i did it for me
admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
so i could come back a brandnew me
you helped see me through
and don't even realize what you did believe me you
i've been through the wringer
but they can do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye i feel like the king of
my world haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on i promise
to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
and raise it you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
â€˜cause the way i feel i'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
â€˜cause i'm raisin' the bar
i'd shoot for the moon but i'm too busy gazin' at stars
i feel amazin' and i'mâ€”

iâ€™m not afraid iâ€™m not afraid
to take a stand to take a stand
everybody everybody
come take my hand come take my hand
weâ€™ll walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just lettin' you know that youâ€™re not alone
holla if you feel like youâ€™ve been down the same road
feels like a close it's coming to
fuck am i gonna do
it's too late to start over
this is the only thing i thing i know

sometimes i feel like all i ever do is
find different ways to word the same old song
ever since i came along
from the day the song called â€œhi my name isâ€ dropped
started thinking my name was fault
â€˜cause any time things went wrong
i was the one who they would blame it on
the media made me the equivalent
of a modernday genghis khan
tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
gangster nah courageous balls
had to change my style they said i'm way too soft
and i sound like az and nas out came the claws
and the fangs been out since then
but up until the instant that i went against it
it was ingrained in me
that i wouldn't amount to a shitstain i thought
no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
do i really belong in this game i pondered
i just wanna play my part
should i make waves or not
so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
and i don't wanna seem ungrateful
or disrespect the artform i was raised upon
but sometimes you gotta take a loss
and have people rub it in your face
before you get made pissed off
and keep plugging it's your only outlet
and your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
better find a way to counter it quick and make itâ€¦ ah
feel like i've already said this a kabillion eighty times
how many times can i say the same thing
different ways that rhyme
what i really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way i felt
when i was in the same place you are when i was afraid toâ€”

i was aâ€¦ afraid to make a single sound
afraid i would never find a way out out out
afraid i'd never be found
i didn't wanna go another round
an angry man's power will shut you up
trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love
run out of excuses for everyone
so here i am and i will not run

guts over fear the time is near
guts over fear i shed a tear
for all the times i let you push me 'round
i let you keep me down
now i got guts over fear guts over fear

feels like a close it's coming to
fuck am i gonna do
it's too late to start over
this is the only thing i thing i know

i know what it was like i was there once
single parents hate your appearance
as you struggle to find your place in this world
and the pain spawns all the anger on
but it wasn't 'til i put the pain in song
learned who to aim it on that i made a spark
started to spit harder shit
learned how to harness it while the reins were off
and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck
haters started to appreciate my art
and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain i caused
but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone
and the lights go out in that trailer park
and the window is closing and there's nowhere else that i can go with flows and i'm frozen
â€˜cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun
so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song
but i rather make â€œnot afraid 2â€
than make another motherfucking â€œwe made youâ€ ah
now i don't wanna seem indulgent
when i discuss my lows and my highs
my demise and my uprise pray to god
i just open enough eyes later on
and gave you the supplies and the tools
to hopefully use that'll make you strong
enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt
â€˜cause i can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
just having to balance my dang self
when on eggshells i was made to walk
but thank you ma â€˜cause that gave me the
strength to cause shadymania so when they empty that stadium
least i made it out of that house
and found a place in this world when the day was done
so this is for every kid who all's they ever did
was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
i represent him or her anyone similar
you are the reason that i made this song
and everything you're scared to say
don't be afraid to say no more
from this day forward just let them aholes talk
take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
the legend of the angry blonde
lives on through you when iâ€™m gone and to think i was aâ€”

i was aâ€¦ afraid to make a single sound
afraid i would never find a way out out out
afraid i'd never be found
i didn't wanna go another round
an angry man's power will shut you up
trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love
run out of excuses for everyone
so here i am and i will not run

guts over fear the time is near
guts over fear i shed a tear
for all the times i let you push me 'round
i let you keep me down
now i got guts over fear guts over fear
yeah it's my life
in my own words i guess

have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for
not the expression no literally give an arm for
when they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor
and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
but what happens when karma turns right around to bite you
and everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
what happens when you become the main source of her pain
daddy look what i made dad's gotta go catch a plane
daddy where's mommy i can't find mommy where is she
i don't know go play hailie baby your daddy's busy
daddy's writing a song this song ain't gon' write itself

extraterrestrial running over pedestrians in a spaceship
while they're screaming at me let's just be friends
ninetynine percent of my life i was lied to

where's my snare
i have no snare in my headphones
there you go yeah yo yo

have you ever been hated or discriminated against
i haveâ€”i've been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as i'm breathin'
keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
look at me now i bet you're probably sick of me now
ain't you mama i'ma make you look so ridiculous now

i'm sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet one more time
i said i'm sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet

i got some skeletons in my closet
and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
i'ma expose it i'll take you back to '73
before i ever had a multiplatinumselling cd
i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
â€˜cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i don't on second thought i just fuckin' wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldn't picture leavin' her side
even if i hated kim i'd grit my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human but i'm man enough to face 'em today
what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets out of that gun
â€˜cause i'da killed him shit i woulda shot kim and him both
it's my life i'd like to welcome y'all to the eminem show

i'm sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet one more time
i said i'm sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet

now i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
but put yourself in my position just try to envision
witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
goin' through public housing systems victim of mã¼nchausen's syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasn't
'til i grew up now i blew up it makes you sick to your stomach doesn't it
wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me ma
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
but guess what you're gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
and nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
and hailie's gettin' so big now you should see her she's beautiful
but you'll never see herâ€”she won't even be at your funeral
see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
bitch do your song keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
you selfish bitch i hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
well guess what i am deadâ€”dead to you as can be

i'm sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet one more time
i said i'm sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet
we touch i feel a rush we clutch it isn't much
but it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
it's lust it's torturous you must be a sorceress
'cause you just did the impossible gained my trust
don't play games it'll be dangerous
if you fuck me over â€˜cause if i get burnt i'ma show ya
what it's like to hurt â€˜cause i been treated like dirt before ya
and love is evil â€” spell it backwards i'll show ya
nobody knows me i'm cold
walk down this road all alone
it's no one's fault but my own
it's the path i've chosen to go
frozen as snow i show no emotion whatsoever so
don't ask me why i have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
bloodsuckin' succubuses
what the fuck is up with this
i've tried in this department but i ain't had no luck with this
it sucks but it's exactly what i thought it would be
like tryin' to start over
i got a hole in my heart but some kinda emotional roller coaster
something i won't go on
so you toy with my emotions ho it's over
it's like an explosion every time i hold ya
wasn't joking when i told ya
you take my breath away you're a supernova and i'm aâ€”

i'm a spacebound rocket ship
and your heart's the moon
and i'm aiming right at you right at you
250000 miles on a clear night in june
and i'm aiming right at you
right at you right at you

i'll do whatever it takes
when i'm with you i get the shakes
my body aches when i ain't with you i have zero strength
there's no limit on how far i would go
no boundaries no lengths
why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
gonna be that one then once we get 'em it's never the same
you want them when they don't want you
soon as they do feelings change
it's not a contest and i ain't on no conquest for no mate
i wasn't lookin' when i stumbled on to you musta been fate
but so much is at stake
what the fuck does it take let's cut to the chase
'fore the door shuts in your face
promise me if i cave in and break and leave myself open
that i won't be makin' a mistake â€˜cause i'm aâ€”

i'm a spacebound rocket ship
and your heart's the moon
and i'm aiming right at you right at you
250000 miles on a clear night in june
and i'm aiming right at you
right at you right at you

so after a year and six months
it's no longer me that you want
but i love you so much it hurts never mistreated you once
i poured my heart out to you
let down my guard swear to god
i blow my brains in your lap lay here and die in your arms
drop to my knees and i'm pleadin'
i'm tryna stop you from leavin'
you won't even listen so fuck it i'm tryna stop you from breathin'
i put both hands on your throat i sit on top of you squeezin'
'til i snap your neck like a popsicle stick ain't no possible reason
i can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
tears stream down both of my cheeks
now i let you go and just give
and 'fore i put that gun to my temple i told you this

and i would've did anything for you
to show you how much i adored you
but it's over now it's too late to save our love
just promise me you'll think of me every time
you look up in the sky and see a star â€˜cause i'm aâ€”

i'm a spacebound rocket ship
and your heart's the moon
and i'm aiming right at you right at you
250000 miles on a clear night in june
and i'm so lost without you
without you without you
step by step heart to heart
left right left
we all fall down

step by step heart to heart
left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit torn apart
we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders i ain't never supposed to show it
my crew ain't supposed to know it
even if it means goin' toe to toe with a benzino
it don't matter i'd never drag them in battles that i can handle
'less i absolutely have to i'm supposed to set an example
i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever does pop off i'm supposed to be beside 'em
that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
there's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy the shit went way beyond some jay z and nas shit
and even though the battle is won i feel like we lost it
i spent so much energy on it honestly i'm exhausted
and i'm so caught in it i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this ain't what i'm in hiphop for it's not why i got in it
that was never my object for someone to get killed
why would i want to destroy something i helped build
it wasn't my intentions my intentions were good
i went through my whole career without ever mentionin' 
and that was just outta respect for not runnin' my mouth
and talkin' about somethin' that i knew nothin' about
plus dre told me stay out this just wasn't my beef
so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
while he's all over tv downtalkin' the man
who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand
this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
i'm still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute â€˜causeâ€”

step by step heart to heart
left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit torn apart
we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
but now it's elevated â€˜cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalated â€” it ain't just words no more is it
it's a different ball game you call names and you ain't just rappin'
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin'
me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
until ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash him mash him and let him have it
meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up
â€˜cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then
but i'm so busy bein' pissed off i don't stop to think
that we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc
and he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
we still have soldiers that's on the front line
who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us strictly to show they support us
and maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus
to show 'em we love 'em back and let them know how important
it is to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
but i ain't tryin' to have none of my people hurt or murdered
it ain't worth it i can't think of a perfecter way to word it
than to just say that i love y'all too much to see the verdict
i'll walk away from it all 'fore i let it go any further
but don't get it twisted it's not a plea that i'm coppin'
i'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
off at your jaws well then i can â€˜cause frankly i'm sick of talkin'
i'm not goin' to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
â€˜causeâ€”

we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit torn apart
we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers
you used to say that i'd never be
nothin' without you and i'd believe
i'm shot in the lungs i gasp i can't breathe
just lay here with me baby hold me please
and i'd beg and i'd plead drop to knees
and i'd cry and i'd scream baby please don't leave
snatch the keys from your hand i would squeeze
and you'd laugh and you'd tease
you're just fucking with me and you must hate me
why do you date me if you say i make you sick
and you've had enough of me
i smother you i'm 'bout to jump off the edge

but you won't break me
you'll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you i bet you i'll be just fine without you
and if i stumble i won't crumble
i'll get back up and uhh
but i'ma still be humble when i scream fuck you
â€˜cause i'm stronger than i was

a beautiful face is all that you have
â€˜cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
but you're all that i love i grasp you can't leave
please stay here with me baby hold me please
and i'd beg and i'd plead drop to knees
and i'd cry and i'd scream baby please don't leave
but you left and you took everything i had left
and left nothin' nothin' for me
so please don't wake me from this dream baby
we're still together in my head
and you're still in love with me
'til i woke up to discover that that dream was dead

but you won't break me
you'll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you i bet you i'll be just fine without you
and if i stumble i won't crumble
i'll get back up and uhh
but i'ma still be humble when i scream fuck you
â€˜cause i'm stronger than i was

you walked out i almost died
it was almost a homicide
that you caused â€˜cause i was so traumatized
felt like i was in for a long bus ride
i'd rather die than you not be by my side
can't count how many times i vomited cried
go to my room turn the radio on and hide
thought we were bonnie and clyde
nah on the inside you were jekyll and hyde
i felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
it was you and i why did i think it was ride or die
â€˜cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
it's like you put a knife through my chest
and pushed it right through to the
other side of my back and stuck a spike too shoulda
put up more of a fight but i couldn't
at the time no one could hurt me like you coulda
take you back now what's the likelihood of that
bite me bitch chew on a nineteen footer
â€˜cause this morning i finally stood up
held my chin up finally showed a sign of life in me for the
first time since you left me
and left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
and the life we coulda had and we coulda been
but i'm breakin' out of this slump i'm in
pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
i'm gettin' up once and for all â€“ fuck this shit
i'ma be late for the pity party
but you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
took it on the chin like a champ
so don't lump me in with them chumpions
i'm done bein' your punching bag
it was the november 31st today
woulda been our anniversary
two years but you left on the 1st of may
i wrote it on a calendar was gonna call
but couldn't think of the words to say
but they came to me just now so i put 'em in a verse to lay

and i thank you â€˜cause you made me
a better person than i was
but i hate you â€˜cause you drained me
i gave you all you gave me none
but if you blame me you're crazy
and after all is said and done
i'm still angry yeah i may be
i may never trust someone

but you won't break me
you'll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you i bet you i'll be just fine without you
and if i stumble i won't crumble
i'll get back up and uhh
but i'ma still be humble when i scream fuck you
â€˜cause i'm stronger than i was
â€¦man whatever
dre just let it run
ayo turn the beat up a little bit
ayo this song is for anyone
fuck it just shut up and listen ayo

i sit back with this pack of zigzag's and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on thisâ€”on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
dispensing these sentences getting this stress
that's been eating me recently off of this chest
and i rest again peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when i'm eating or feeding my daughter
to not come and speak to me i don't know you
and no i don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
i'm not mr n'sync i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr friendly i can be a prick if you tempt me
my tank is on empty no patience is in me
and if you offend me i'm lifting you ten feet in the air
i don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of all you i don't mean to be mean
but that's all i can be it's just me

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio won't even play my jam
'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i don't know it's just the way i am

sometimes i just feel like my father
i hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense
it's constant and oh it's his lyrical content
the song 'guilty conscience' has gotten such rotten responses
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
so i point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
when a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn and the heroin
where were the parents at and look where it's at
middle america now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see an upperclass city havin' this happening
then attack eminem â€˜cause i rap this way
but i'm glad â€˜cause they feed me the fuel that i need
for the fire to burn and it's burning and i have returned

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio won't even play my jam
'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i don't know it's just the way i am

i'm so sick and tired of being admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label let's stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top on my name is
and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
to cop me rotation at rocknroll stations
and i just do not got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians
who think i'm some wigger who just tries to be black
â€˜cause i talk with an accent and grab on my balls
so they always keep asking the same fucking questions
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in
the why the who what when the where and the how
'til i'm grabbing my hair and i'm tearin' it out
â€˜cause they driving me crazy i can't take it
i'm racin' i'm pacin' i stand and i sit
and i'm thankful for every fan that i get
but i can't take a shit
in the bathroom without someone standing by it
no i won't sign you an autograph
you can call me an asshole i'm glad

'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio won't even play my jam
'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i don't know it's just the way i am
yeah tryin' to figure out the difference
but i think the lines are starting to get blurred

i'm in a strange place
i feel like mae when he gave up the game for his faith
i feel like i'm caged in these chains and restraints
grimmin' every stranger in the place while i gaze into space
â€˜cause i'm mentally rearrangin' his face
i need a change of pace
â€˜cause the pace i'm working at is dangerous
there's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
i done quit chicken heads cold turkey
and started slowly roasting 'em
â€˜cause that's where most of my anger is based
fuck your feelings i feel like i play for the saints
i just want to hurt you â€“ aim for the skanks
then aim for all these fake kanye's
jay's wayne's and the drake's
i'm frustrated â€˜cause ain't no more n'sync now i'm all out of whack
i'm all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
i'm going all out in this rap shit
and whatever the fallout is i'm strapped
for battle sucka â€“ duck crawl out the back
it's a bar fight prepare your arsenal
and beware of bar stools flying through the air
and bottles breaking mirrors also
and i ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
you done called every woman a slut
but you're forgetting sarah marshall palin
oh my bad slut and next time i show up to court
i'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit
judge be like that's sharp
how much did that motherfucker cost you
smartass you're lucky i don't tear it off you
and jump your bones you sexy motherfucker
you're so fuckin' gravy marshall i should start calling you 'au jus'
â€˜cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
evil twin take this beat now it's all you
i believe people can change but only for the worse
i coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
so satanic kmart chains panic
â€˜cause they can't even spin back the curse words
â€˜cause they're worse when they're reversed motherfucker
rape your mother kill your parents
shit motherfucker and these kids are like parrots
they run around the house just like terrorists
screaming fuck shit fuck adult with a childishlike arrogance
wild ever since the day i came out i was like merits
fuck that i'd rather be loud and i like swearing
from the first album even the gals were like tight lyrics
dreamy eyes but my fuckin' mouth was nightmareish
and from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
opposition felt the opposite sometimes i listen
and revisit them old albums often as i can and
skim through all them bitches
to make sure i keep up with my competition
ha ha hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes
borderline genius who's bored of his lines
and that sort of defines where i'm at and the way i feel now
feel like i might just strike first and ignore the replies

there's darkness closing in there it goes again
it controls my pen but that ain't me it's my evil twin
then i step out and see my evil twin
he gives me an evil grin
but he's just a friend who pops up now and again
so don't blame me just blame him it's my evil twin
i step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin

welcome back to the land of the living my friend
you have slept for quite some time

so who's left lady gaga mess with the bieber
nah f with christina
i ain't fuckin' with either jessica neither simpson or alba
my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
get the chloraseptic excedrin aleve or
extra strength tylenol 3's
feel like i'm burning to death but i'm freezin'
bedridden and destined never to leave the
bedroom ever again like the legend of heathuh
ledger my suicide notes barely legible read the
bottom it's signed by the joker
lorena said i never can leave her
she'd sever my wiener i ever deceive her
fuck that shit bitch give up my dick for pussy
i'd be jerry mathers i ever left it to beaver
get them titties cut off tryin' to mess with a cleaver
gollywally i vent heat register jesus
ever since 19946 dresden it was definitely
my destiny when on the steps i met deshaun
at osborn i'd never make it to sophomore
i just wanted to skip school and rap used to mop floors
flip burgers and wash dishes
while i wrote rhymes tryin' to get props for 'em
â€˜cause i took booksmarts and swapped for 'em
they were sleeping i made 'em stop snorin'
made them break out the popcorn
now i've been hiphop in it's tiptop form
since nwa was blaring through my car windows
leaning on the horn screaming fuck the police like cop porn
flipped rap on its ear like i dropped corn
fuck top five bitch i'm top four
and that includes biggie and pac whore
and i got an evil twin
so who the fuck do you think that third and that fourth spot's for
and crazy as i am i'm much tamer than him
and i'm nuts then again who the fuck wants a plain eminem
but no one's insaner than slim look at that evil grin
evil twin please come in what was your name again
hi faggot look who's back
with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
two rabbits a koala bear and a ball of hair
and you're all aware i don't got it all upstairs
guess that's why i'm an addict and it's so small up there
peace to whitney jeez just hit me
that i should call the looney police to come get me
â€˜cause i'm so sick of being the truth
i wish someone finally admit me
to a mental hospital with britney
oh lmfao no way jo
se baez couldn't beat this rap â€“ oj no
hooray i'm off the hook like casey anthony hey ho
heyho i sound like i'm tryin' to sing
the fuckin' chorus to hip hop hooray no
iâ€™m hollerin' you got bottomend like an 80
8 and i 'base' whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
let your low end raise yo
tango what you think ho slow dancing or bowling
you tryin' to hold hands with your homie
what you think i'm looking for romance â€˜cause i'm lonely
change that tune you ain't got a remote chance to control me
ho i'm only vulnerable when i got a boner
superman try to fuck me over it won't hurt
don't try to fix me i'm broke so i don't work
so are you but you're broke â€˜cause you don't work
but all bullshit aside i hit a stride
still shady inside hair every bit as dyed
as it used to be when i first introduced y'all to my skittish side
and blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
â€˜cause we are the same bitch
these ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing
it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walkin' around with his headphones blaring
alone in his own zone cold and he don't care he's
a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
'cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are wacked he's mad so he's talkin' back
talkin' black brainwashed from rock and rap
he sags his pants doorags and a stockin' cap
his stepfather hit him so he socked him back
and broke his nose his house is a broken home
there's no control he just lets his emotions go

sing with me sing for the year sing it
sing for the laughter sing for the tear come on
sing it with me just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

entertainment is changin' intertwinin' with gangsters
in the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy only have one homie
only this gun lonely â€˜cause don't anyone know me
yet everybody just feels like they can relate
i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate
it's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
from standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
to havin' a fortune no more kissin' ass
but then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
that's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
so i'm signin' cd's while police fingerprint me
they're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense b
it's all political if my music is literal
and i'm a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i couldn't i wouldn't be fit to
you're full of shit too guerrera that was a fist that hit you

sing with me sing for the year sing it
sing for the laughter sing for the tear sing this shit
sing it with me just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
see what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
and they wanna get one â€˜cause they think the shit's cool
not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
we entertainers of course the shit's affectin' our sales
you ignoramus but music is reflection of self
we just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail
it's fucked up ain't it
how we can come from practically nothin'
to bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
who post pinup pictures on they walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
so they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
that's why we seize the moment
try to freeze it and own it squeeze it and hold it
â€˜cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
just let our spirits live on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we canâ€¦

sing with me sing for the year sing it
sing for the laughter sing for the tear come on
sing it with me just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away
sing with me sing for the year sing it
sing for the laughter sing for the tear come on
sing it with me just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

hands up officer donâ€™t shoot
then pull your pants up promise you won't loot
we may never understand each other itâ€™s no use
we ainâ€™t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

black boy black boy we ain't gonna lie to you
black boy black boy we don't like the sight of you
pull up on the side of you
window rolled down 'profile'
then we wonder why we see this side of you
probably comin' from the dope house
we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out
we know you're hidin' that heidi klum
on you another drug charge homie it's back inside for you
and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true
pistol drew right at you we'd be delighted to unload it
in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
fucked up but what the fuck am i to do
i keep tellin' myself keep doin' like you're doin'
no matter how many lives you ruin
it's for the red white and blue
time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
no one's ever indicted you
why 'cause you're a

white boy white boy you're a rockstar
my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live
white boy white boy in your cop car
but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve
white boy white boy you're untouchable
the world's coming to an end i don't even care
nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar

black boy black boy we don't get your culture and
we don't care what our government's done to fuck you over man
don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
balderdash whereâ€™d you get the chip on your shoulder at
why you kicking that soda can
pull your pants up we 'bout to roll up and
throw your ass in the van cuffed
you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands
and put our minds more at ease
or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy
we're fightin' a crime war here come the swine
tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
that's what we call 'em pigsties for
they're like eyesores to police
talk to you like just a piece of trash
feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
as this beat backspins it's like we're drifting back in
to the sixties having black skin is risky
'cause this keeps happening
throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit
and i admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a

white boy white boy you're a rockstar
my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live
white boy white boy in your cop car
but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve

the world's coming to an end i don't even care

seems like the average lifespan of a white man
is more than twice than a black life span
i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
i feel like checking out on life can't escape this circumstance
i'd rather hear 'em say die nword than die antwoord
ninja now it's better disguised banter
but that's life strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
and can't find answers
we're applying but mcdonald's
seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
so how can we have higher standards
as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter
we fight back with violence but acts like that are
black eyes on the movement
which makes black lives madder
at cops and cops madder
that's why it's at a stalemate
and can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops
i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops
the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot
call the attack dogs off of us man
you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop
sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
who ain't acclimated to 'em like that's the way to do it
who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
and know nobody black so they act afraid of us
and that's racism the fear that a black face gives 'em
a subconscious racist
wait why are there black neighborhoods
'cause america segregated us designated us to an area
separated us sectioneight'd us
when we tear it upâ€™s the only time attentionâ€™s paid to us
and education sucks and every day's another
freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz
why is it they treat us like dryer lint
we just want a safe environment for our kids
but canâ€™t escape the sirens
donâ€™t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
the poverty that we face so the crime rateâ€™s the highest in
the lowest classes it's like a razor wire fence
and weâ€™re trapped in these racial biases
that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
every time we see a devilâ€™s face
lions tigers and bears oh my
it's more like billy clubs and gats
and we really love it when you think weâ€™re guilty â€˜cause weâ€™re black
but you kill each other facts
you peel each other's caps for silly stuff like hatsâ€
single mother strugglinâ€™ through substance abuse
while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
fuck your republican views
pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots
and streets act as a narrator don't gotta read comics
or be that into characters just to see that just to be black
you better be strapped with a derringer
or be â€œcapped in americaâ€ like steve rogers
'cause no one oversees these cops and
all we see is 'em beat charges
we done seen 'em beat rodney king unconscious and got off
so we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
just keep marchin' 'til we reach congress
but they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
if you try to slander the flag but
somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
so they call it a kaepernick tantrum
if you don't stand for the national anthem
we raise it you better praise it
or you'll be made to feel like a traitor we'll
treat you like rodney dangerfield
home of the brave is still racist 'ville
so this whole nation feels like a plantation field
in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals
that had its natives killed
got you singin' this starspangled spiel
to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build
mhmmm inhales

detroit vs everybody

i took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
all these females need to email to make noise
and now things changin' a lot
he fuck with my authority
then he shall see shells but not by the seashore
if he gang bangin' or not
it's simple as the alphabet
he f with me that g shall surely see
he definitely as 'bout it as retail fraud he's sweet
the honest gesture
the trigger finger 'round the diamond tester
we tell flaw with heat
the same soldier it's me myself and i
ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography
range rover this ain't the squash beef state
you thinkin' makeup we thinkin' lark voorhies face
the twin eagles'll air his coupe
might as well ride by in an ambulance
my pair'll shoot like skydivin' in hammer pants
so call it siblin' rivalry
take his life call it the unforgivable robbery
a wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rentfree real talk
i don't got time to evict these clowns
y'all niggas been bitches
that's none of my business but i don't sip tea it's nickel
ridin' 'round his block all he know is pitfalls
that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
i got a question do you wanna ride or die
welcome to detroit motherfucka sean donâ€¦

boy i need no halves and halves i want the game in entirety
hundred percent cut no stitches required
welcome to detroit where if you get that promotion
don't worry man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
i still call it safe i would suck if i was umpirin'
boy i hit the beat i just treat that shit like a diary
i'm offended if you hear my new shit
and you ain't rewindin' me
selfmade i never needed your bail or a wire see
i'm never callin' collect i call to collect
my homie wanted a chevy so i put my dog in the 'vette
ahh plus i'm so loyal that that paper boy is all that i fetch
if the ball in my hand then the ball in the net
bitch i'm the d can't no offense dunk on me
i'm mr big shot these hoes get drunk off me
i'm overrespected
my mama gated community's overprotective
so futuristic i'm already over my next bitch
reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
tryna get paid fifty ways a day
used to put fifty on the layaway
now my closet fifty shades of grey
26 and i done lived a lifetime a few times
from futons to grey poupons
in church tryna get a little savings yeah a coupon
i spit that a1 every day i'm hittin' new primes
now the stakes high niggas surprised at the new lines
takin' down my number like you still ain't got a new line
nah it's the same we been laborin' for years
i know it took way longer than nine months
but fuck it it's all in due time
i turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a beatle
don't want to i need to ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
when you come up in a place
where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
this is just part one wait 'til the sequel lil' bitch

tell 'em if they want it
they can come get that static
i swear i love my city
i just want less static
see me they salute me
they ain't ready for that static
detroit vs everybody

comin' from them streets where they thirsty starvin' to eat
just a step away from failin' that's why they call it the d
arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
honestly no honor roll but honored up in them streets
â€˜cause i'm a linwood nigga them young niggas hit ya
put a stack on your head you'll bleed a lake on grand river
if you think your hood harder then i might beg to differ
know some killers pull the trigger for a swisher and miller
if the blicka hit ya kisser bet yo' ass not rememberin'
they say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
so nigga i'm a veteran retire my letterman
have k's in front of your school but i ain't goin' to kettering
cough up a lung 313 where i'm from
xan got me crosseyed like bernsteinâ€™s son
any nigga try to copy put a hole in his top
it's us vs them detroit vs everybody

lately it seems as if it's me against
the world like it was before my life became a movie and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
but i flipped that script like a refill of
painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
it made me feel amazing navy seal of bravery
and if i may reiterate i ain't even need a script
ain't bein' conceited but i made it to radioâ€”eat a dick
i still never abc this shit
mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller
since before they called jay dee dilla
i was daydreamin' one day i would be the shit
and if i ever end up escapin' these streets
i swear that i would stay here still
and if i'm crazy i'll always be real
don't make me steal an eighteenwheeler
break all of my friends out of here
and take 'em straight to the mercedes dealer
peel off back to the same block that we came from
on a rampage too crazy for me to flip
what's makin' you think i need a switch
â€˜cause i'm adrian peterson
when he's ragin' and heated and
on the way to go beat his kid
on a track get spanked like he just did
detroit i can't never leave this bitch
sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
but jesus i can see just why people quit callin' me to do features and them cyphers on bet â€˜cause if
i wasn't me i probably wouldn't
want to play with me neither shit
seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
hundred and eighty degrees in here
shoulder blade full of cedar chips
mc's just bit off more than they can chew
like a face full of swedish fish
or lorena with two penises
hateful and geniusness inconvenience
and for the record you don't want this type of static
in your life when i'm makin' you cling to it
may consider tryin' to reinsulate your windows
may be in for another crazy winter
â€˜cause so cold in the d it is
as days begin to tick away but ain't this really
what made me into the angry bitter blonde
but ain't we sick of bein' underdogs
don't make me unleash this shit release this pit
may even seem as if i'm yankin' your chain a bit
or maybe the way in which i'm sayin' shit
is playin' with you but ain't shit changin'
it's still the same shit and shady's still a lady killer
since the day i went insane and then attacked the babysitter
with a potato peeler
and mushed her face into the entertainment center
it's like another plane just entered into ukraine again
or the bermuda triangle and
attempted to make a safe descent
awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated it could be danger
did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here and if they mention usâ€¦

tell 'em if they want it
they can come get that static
i swear i love my city
i just want less static
see me they salute me
they ain't ready for that static
detroit vs everybody

what up though it's the godfather trick trick

and i thought wouldn't shit
just be a lot easier if you dropped dead
i would feel so much better

think i just relapsed this bitch pushed me over the brink
hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'til the cops pulled me over
but they let me go 'cause i told 'em i'm only drivin' drunk
'cause that bitch drove me to drink
i'm back on my fuck hoes with a whole new hatred for blondes
but bias i hate all bitches the same baby come on
excuse the pun but bitch is such a broad statement and i'm
channelin' my anger through every single station that's on
'cause a woman broke my heart
i say heart 'cause she ripped it in two paarts
and threw it in the garbage who do you think you aare
bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off
and pick myself up off the carpet
but i'll never say the lword again
i lolololoâ€¦ lesbian aaahhh
i hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
my life'd be so much better if you justâ€”

my life would be so much better
if you just dropped dead
i was layin' in bed last night thinkin'
and this thought just popped in my head
and i thought wouldn't shit
just be a lot easier if you dropped dead
i would feel so much better

'cause you told me
you'd love me forever
bitch that was a lie
now i never wanted someone
to die so bad in my fuckin' life
but fuck it thereâ€™s other fish in the sea

and i'ma have a whale of a time bein' a single sailor
for the night bitch on a scale of
one to ten shit i must be the holy grail of
catches ho i got an oscar
attached to my fuckin' name de la
i might hit the club find a chick that's tailor
made for me say fuck it
kick some shots back get hammered and nail her
these bitches tryin' to get attached but they're failin'
to latch onto the tail of
my bumper they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
like i'm itchin' to get hitched
yeah i'm rich as a bitch
but bitches ain't shit i'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
bitch you complain when you listen to this
but you still throw yourself at me that's what i call pitchin' a bitch
that's why i'm swingin' at this chicks onsite
long as i got a bat and two balls it's foul but my dick's on strike
so all that love shit is null and void bitch i'm a droid
i avoid cupid stupid wasn't for blow jobs you'd be unemployed
oyeyoyyoy manohman your boyboyboy's
gettin' sick of these girlsgirlsgirls oinkoinkoink
you fuckin' pigs all you're good for is doinkdoinkdoink
i got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
she's all 99 of 'em i need a machine gun
i'll take 'em all out i hope you hear this song
and go into a cardiac arrest have a heart attack and just
drop dead and i'ma throw a fuckin' party after this 'cause yes

my life would be so much better
if you just dropped dead i hate you
i was layin' in bed last night thinkin'
and this thought just popped in my head you made me like this way
and i thought wouldn't shit
just be a lot easier if you dropped dead bitch
i would feel so much better

i'm just playin' bitch
you know i love you
and i started from the bottom
like a snowmanâ€”groundup
like round chuck and still put hands on you
stayin' wound up is how i spend time get it
sucker free confidence high
such a breeze when i pen rhymes
i just got that air about me like wind chimes yeah
another day in the life uh
used to have to scrape to get by yeah
now my community's gated and i
made it and my neighbors say hi say hi
i'm givin' 'em pounds i'm upscale now
guess it means i'm way in the sky way in the sky
but i still remember the days of
minimum wage for general labor
welfare recipient since a minor
look how government assistance has made ya
adversity if at first you don't succeed
put your temper to more use
'cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
that should only give you more fuel
show 'em why you're you
so close god it's like i almost got it
but close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
so i unabomb shitâ€”tick tick tickâ€”no remorse pew
screw it i'm lit and that attitude i blew up on quick
that's why they call me firecracker
i grew up on wicâ€”wick wick wickâ€”with a short fuse
i got some important news to report to
anyone who thought i was done nah bitch not quite
spotlight's back on got my faith where's yours

do you still believe in me
didn't i give everything i had to give you to make you see
i'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
and walk out i will never let you live it down
i'll never quit do you still believe in me

man i know sometimes
these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
to me they're just ink blots
i just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
so you might wanna think it over twice yeah
or you retards can roll the dice
but beef will at least cost you your career
'cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
but this middle finger's free as a bird
nuke warhead at birth hugest forehead on earth
too short for the verse studied his formula learned
how to incorporate a curse
point it towards corporate america
stick a fork in and turn
'cause fourletter words are more better heard
the world forcefed a turd to me you're getting yours
but sometimes i overdo it but i just get so into it
i was there consolin' you when no one knew it
when your situation showed no improvement
i was that door you walked over to it
i'm the light at the end of tunnel
so people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
when that tunnel vision is unclear
shit becomes too much to bear
since cleanin' out my closet
when i was havin' trouble with the snare
i'm that unrealistic prayer answered
and i'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat uh
when you struggle with despair
that doublefisted bareknuckles coupled with this pair
of nuts i'm cuppin' i am your fuckin' switch nothin' can compare

do you still believe in me
didn't i give everything i had to give you to make you see
i'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
and walk out i will never let you live it down
i'll never quit do you still believe in me

started from the bottom like a snowman
oh man put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
but my battery's low i'ma need a boost to my pack
and i know that i always got proof at my back
i called you proof because i knew for a fact
my ace in the hole homie i'm callin' on you
'cause i think i'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it so
give me that apron and moâ€“
â€“tivation to go hussein with the flow
fake fans left you twofaced at the show
let heartbeats loop produce hate in my soul
layin' vocals two days in a row
true statement hate to go down this road
but there's only one route to cross this bridge
so i walk in this bitch with loose change
'cause all my dues paid but this booth's takin' its toll
but it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
that goes for you too so what the fuck you gon' do
use the tools you're given
or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
as an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em
i used to play the loservictim
'til i saw the way proof was driven
i found my vehicle and i haven't ran out of gas yet
and when they stacked decks turn handicaps into assets
fanny packs hourglasses
if time was on my side i'd still have none to waste
man in my younger days
that dream was so much fun to chase
it's like i'd run in place
while this shit dangled in front of my face
but how do you keep up the pace
and the hunger pangs once you've won the race
when that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grã¢ce
still you feel the need to go full tilt
that bruce willis that blue steel that true skill
when that wheel's loose i won't lose will
do you still believe

she wants kielbasa prearrange an escape plan
threeinch blade on point like a seeandsay
consider me a dangerous man
but you should be afraid of this dang candidate
you say trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
and that's what you wanted
a fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
who doesn't have to answer to no oneâ€”great idea
if i was president gettin' off is
the first order of business once i get in office
second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to uncle sam
naked laughin' dick cupped in hand
screamin' fuck safe sex
throw a latex and an aids test at him
tell congress i run this land
and i want the rubber banned and make it snappy
addiction to friction and static
addict who can't escape the habit
continue to chase the dragon
but as fate would have it i walked up in major magics
dressed as the maintenance man
in a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
with a gauge to blast it
and sped away in the station wagon
stacey dash's and casey anthony's
crazy asses in the backseat
throwin' stayfree pads at me
dead passenger in the passenger seat
unfasten the safety latches
and slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
i snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
'finna get a murder case and catch it
like you threw it at me encased in plastic
and send dylann roof through the windshield of the benz
until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'
like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin'
and skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
swing for the fence like prince fielder
knock it into the upper peninsula
you wanna go against 'zilla the rap god
when will i quit never been realer
the instiller of fear not even a scintilla of doubt
whose pens iller than prince in a chinchilla
or ben stiller in a suspense thriller
revenge killer avenge syllable binge
fill a syringe 'til i
draw first blood
even pop shit on my pop shit and it's popular
couldn't be more awkwarder
cause you're innocence i robbed you of
it's my fingers that got stuck up
taught ya ta not give a
slapstick hockey puck
the broad hunter with the sawed off
like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
but i'm not gonna get the shotgun
or the glock i'm gonna opt for the ox
cause i'm into objects that are sharp when i shop
and it's not a shock i'm such an obnoxious fucker
the rock hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought
this much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of vivica fox with a box cutter
that was for 50 little slap on the wrist be warned
i'm unravelin' quickly
my squabbles i'm grappling with your time traveling with me
try and follow as i wobble relapse into history with a flask of the whiskey
tip it back then i'm twisting wine bottles
like what happened to chris reeve's spine column
that's the plan of attack when i'm fixing my problems
wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
but the fact that i have so many rappers against me mind boggles
and why i haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is
more of a spectacular mystery than a fucking agatha christie crime novel
but my patience is wearing thin
swear i been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til i smear it in
diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
and never appear again
if you actually had fuckin' careers to end
but then i think of molly qerim and i steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
molly i'm gone off you
man light some kush
you're my first take i'll nail you
can't lie i gush
if i won you over you would be the grand prize
i'm entranced by your looks come and give the shady franchise a push
you can get it in the can like some anheuser busch
jeans too small least three pant sizes tush
mushed against your damn side your puss
and thighs are squished
what kind of attire's that
i'm ready to be rode
psychopath bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat
light the match to ignite the wrath
got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
piper chapmans might just have to picket me
like a scab
hard to describe in fact
startling violent perhaps
are things that come to mind as soon as i start spitting rhymes like that
and you aren't really surprised at that
but as far as these lines i rap
and these bars wouldn't dial it back if i star 69ed the track
why am i such a dick
what's your name marshall
who's your daddy i don't have one

my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
and had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in
the side of locomotive with rap i'm
loco it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'bout to explode all over the canvas
back with the yoda of rap in a spasm
your music usually has 'em
but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
follow you must rick rubin my little padawan
a jedi in training colossal brain and
thoughts are entertainin'
but docile and impossible to explain and i'm also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting
puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk
full of such blind rage i need a seein' eye dog
can't even find the page i was writing this rhyme on
oh it's on the rampage
couldn't see what i wrote i write small
it says ever since i drove a '79 lincoln with whitewalls
had a fire in my heart
and a dire desire to aspire to die hard
so as long as i'm on the clock punching this time card
hiphop ain't dying on my watch

now sometimes when i'm sleepin'
she comes to me in my dreams
is she taken is she mine
don't got time don't care don't have two shits to give
let me take you by the hand to promised land
and threaten everyone
'cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

now what's your name marshall
who's your daddy i donâ€™t know him but i wonder
is he rich like me ha
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live

no if he had
he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
i wouldn't be so mad my attitude wouldn't be so bad
yeah dad i'm the epitome and the prime
example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
falls into the wrong hands and
makes you want to get up and start dancin'
even if it is charles manson
who just happens to be rappin' blue lights flashin'
laughin' all the way to the bank lampin' in my kmart mansion
iâ€™m in the style department
with a pile in my cart rippin' the aisle apart but
with great power comes
absolutely no responsibility for content
completely despondent and condescending
the king of nonsense and controversy is on a
beatkilling spree your honor
i must plead guilty 'cause i sparked a revolution
rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
of rap to take it to the next level boost it
but several rebuked it and whoever produced it
hiphop is the devil's music
does that mean it belongs to me
'cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
that don't honk but every time i speak you hear a beep
but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper
rappers better stay clear of me bitch 'cause it's theâ€”

it's the time of the season
when hate runs high
and this time i won't give it to you easy
when i take back what's mine
with pleasured hands
and torture everyone that is my plan
my job here isn't done
'cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

what's your name shady
who's your daddy i donâ€™t give a fuck but i wonder
is he rich like me doubt it ha
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live

so yeah dad let's walk
let's have us a father and son talk
but i bet we wouldn't probably get one block
without me knocking your block off this is all your fault
maybe that's why i'm so bananas i appealed to all those walks
of life whoever had strife
maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'cause i related to the struggles of young america
when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
now they're rippin' out their fuckin' hair again it's hysterical
i chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
yeah uhoh better beware knuckle heads
the sign of my hustle says
don't knock the door's broken it won't lock
it might just fly open get coldcocked
you critics come to pay me a visit
misery loves company please stay a minute
kryptonite to a hypocrite
zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
to kick rocks then you wonder why i lash out
mr mathers as advertised on the flyers so spread the word
'cause i'm promoting my passion until i'm passed out
completely braindead rain man
doing a bankhead in a restraint chair
so bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
or get shanked in the pancreas
i'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
put together with chief keef 'cause i hate every fuckin' thang yeah
even this rhyme bitch
and quit tryin' look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there
but i still am a criminal
tenyearold degenerate grabbin' on my genitals
the last mathers lp done went diamond
this time i'm predicting this one will go emerald
when will the madness end
how can it when there's no method to the pad and pen
the only message that i have to send
is dad i'm back at it again

yeahâ€¦ who's your daddy
i can feel the heat risin'
everything is on fire
today is a painful reminder
of why we can only get brighter
the further you put it behind ya
but right now i'm on the inside
lookin' out â€˜causeâ€”

i'm standin' in the flames
itâ€™s a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light
i'm standin' in the flames
itâ€™s a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

yesterday was the tornado warning
today's like the morning after your world is torn in half
you wake in its wake to start the mourning process
and rebuilding you're still a work in progress
today's a whole new chapter
it's like an enormous asthma
thunderstorm has passed ya
you weathered it and poked its eye out
with the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses
stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is
stuffed so focused on the bright side
then you floor the gas pedal
and hit the corner fast the more asserted
never looking back may hit the curb
but every day is a new learning curve
as you steer through life
sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
to avert a disaster lucky no permanent damage
â€˜cause they hurt you so bad
it's like they murdered your ass
and threw dirt on your casket
but you've returned from the ashes
and that hurt that you have you just converted to gasoline
and while you're burning the past
standing in the inferno and chantâ€”

i'm standin' in the flames
itâ€™s a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light
i'm standin' in the flames
itâ€™s a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

you're so familiarized
with what having to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time they take your heart and steal your life
and it's as though you feel you've died
â€˜cause you've been killed inside
but yet you're still alive which means you will survive
although today you may weep â€˜cause you're weakened
and everything seems so bleak and
hopeless the light that you're seekin'
it begins to seep in that's the only thing keepin'
you from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
and i'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
and with a little time that should do the healing
and by tomorrow you may even feel so good
that you're willing to forgive 'em
even after all the shit you been put through this feeling
of resilience is building and the flames are burning
quick as fire would through this building
you're sealed in but you're fireproof
flame retardant you withstood it
and as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin'
you look down â€˜cause you're so over 'em
you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

as time passes things change every day
but wounds wounds heal
but scars still remain the same
but tomorrow today's going down in flames
throw the match set the past ablaze

so feel the fire beneath your feet
as you barely even perspire from the heat
exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
and as you say goodbye to the grief
it's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
but you've extinguished this livin' hell
still a little piece of you dies as you screamâ€”

i'm standin' in the flames
itâ€™s a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light
i'm standin' in the flames
itâ€™s a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

i feel the burn watch the smoke as i turn
rising a phoenix from the flames
i have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
not with fists but with wings that i will fly

and i'm standin' in the flames
itâ€™s a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light
i'm standin' in the flames
itâ€™s a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

yo you might see me joggin' you might see me walkin'
you might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
with its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollerin' at him â€˜cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
drivin' up the block in the car that they shot pac in
looking for big's killers dressin' ridiculous
blue and red like i don't see what the big deal is
double barrel 12gauge bigger than chris wallace
pissed off â€˜cause biggie and pac just missed all this
watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
and amidst all this crist' poppin' and wrist watches
i just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of remy martin
startin' shit like some 26yearold skinny cartman goddamn it

and i don't need help from d12 to beat up two females
in makeup who may try to scratch me with lee nails
slim anus you damn right slim anus

â€˜cause i'm just marshall mathers marshall mathers

my fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for 10 million
she must want a dollar for every pill i've been stealin'

family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
all of a sudden i got ninetysome cousins hey it's me
a halfbrother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on tv
now everybody's so happy and proud
i'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house hey

i don't know why all the fuss about me fuss about me
nobody ever gave a fuck before
all they did was doubt me did was doubt me
now everybody wanna run their mouth
and try to take shots at me take shots at me
came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
an asshole that role i think i succeeded fulfillin'
but don't think i ever stopped
to think that i was speaking to children
everything was happening so fast
it was like i blinkedâ€”sold three million
then it all went blank all i remember is feelin' ridiculous
â€˜cause i was getting sick of this feelin'
like i am always under attack man
i could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
women dishin' but really thinking if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him
guess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite when i'm rippin' shit
but since when did this many people ever give a shit
what i had to say it's just my opinion
if it contradicts how i'm livin' put a dick in your rear end
that's why every time you mentioned a lyric
i thanked you for it for drawing more attention toward it
â€˜cause it gave me an enormous platform
i'm flattered you thought i was that important
but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect
and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed
attaboy they told me to slow down and i just zoned out
good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
it's like telling gwen stefani that she sold out
â€˜cause i was tryin' to leave no doubt
in anyone's mind one day i'd go down in history
think they know now because everybody knows

everybody knows that you're just an asshole
everywhere that you go
people wanna go home everyone knows
everybody knows so don't pretend to be nice
there's no place you can hide
you are just an asshole
everyone knows everyone knows

thanks for the support asshole scratch
thanks for the support asshole

quit actin' salty i was countin' on you to count me out
ask asher roth when he round about
dissed me to shout me out
thought i was history but goddamn honky
that compliment's like backhanding a donkey
good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
nah i'm off him
but what the fuck is all this trashtalkin' about
the fight was fixed i'm back and you can't stop me
you knocked me down i went down for the count
i fell but the fans caught me and now
you're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
to take my beltâ€”word to pacquiao
momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
better go in that ring and knock 'em out
or you better not come out
it's poetry in motion
like freddie roach when he's quotin' shakespeare
so what if the insults are revoltin'
even helen keller knows life stinks
you think it's a joke 'til you're bulletriddled
but you should give little shit what i think
this whole world is a mess
gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
and a glock just to go watch batman
who needs to test a testicles not that man
half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
rest of you got lap bands
stuck to this motto before they put bath salts
and all those water bottles in colorado so get lost waldo
my soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
a black hole and i'm swallowin' this track whole
better pack toilet paper but i'm taking no crap ho
here i go down the bat pole
and i'm changing back into that old maniac
in fact there they go tryin' to dip out the backdoor retreatin'
â€˜cause everybody knows

everybody knows that you're just an asshole
everywhere that you go
people wanna go home everyone knows
everybody knows so don't pretend to be nice
there's no place you can hide
you are just an asshole
everyone knows everyone knows

holy mackerel i'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth
i smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
for thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
then screamed icp in this bitch how do fuckin' magnets work
â€˜cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable
hate to be dramatical but i'm not romantical
i'm making up words you can understandable it's tragical
thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen that ain't practical
you crackin' a joke it's laughable
â€˜cause me and love's like a bad combination
i keep them feelings locked in a vault
so it's safe to say i'm uncrackable
my heart is truly guarded full body armor
bitch you just need a helmet
â€˜cause if you think you're special you're retarded
thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
you're a train wreck i got a onetrack mind
shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
â€˜cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
been tryna hunt me down like a dog
â€˜cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
â€˜cause all of my spare time is spent
on my nose in this binder so don't bother tryin'
only women that i love are my daughters
but sometimes i rhyme and it sounds like i forget i'm a father
and i push it farther
so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line
it's apparent i shouldn't have been a parent
i'll never grow up so to hell with your parents
and motherfuckin' father time
it ain't never gonna stop a pessimist
who transformed to an optimist in his prime
so even if i'm halfdead i'm half alive
poured my half empty glass in a cup
so now my cup has runneth over
and i'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
iâ€™m going back to what got me here
yeah cocky and canâ€™t knock being rude off so fear not my dear
and dry up your teardrops i'm here
white america's mirror so don't feel awkward or weird
if you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too
shouldn't be a shock because everybody knows

everybody knows that you're just an asshole
everywhere that you go
people wanna go home everyone knows
everybody knows so don't pretend to be nice
there's no place you can hide
you are just an asshole
everyone knows everyone knows
here to stay
even when i'm gone
when i close my eyes
through the passage of time
kings never die

i can hear the drummer drummin'
and the trumpets someone's tryna summon someone
i know something's comin'
but i'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
and plummet how come it wasn't what i thought it was
was it too good to be true
have nothin' get it all but too much of it
then lose it again did i swallow hallucinogens
â€˜cause if not where the hell did it go
â€˜cause here i sit in luciferâ€™s den by the dutch oven
just choosing to sin even if it means i'm sellin' my soul
just to be the undisputed again
do whatever i gotta do just to win
â€˜cause i got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
crown around it thorns on it
cracks in it bet you morons didn't think i'd be back did ya
how 'bout that iâ€™m somehow now back to the underdog
but no matter how loud that i bark
this sport is somethin' i never bowout at
i complain about the game i shout and i pout it's a lovehate
but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt
even when you bitches are countin' me out
and i appear to be down for the count
only time i ever been out and about
is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
â€˜cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here
but i'm not a quitter gotta get up give it all i got or give up
spit on shit on stepped on but kept goin'
i'm tryna be headstrong
but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong
â€˜cause you're moving onto the next but is your respect gone
â€˜cause someone told me thatâ€¦

kings never die

don't give me that sob story liar don't preach to the choir
you ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
nobody ever handed me shit in life not even a flyer
wouldn't even take shit into consideration
obliterate anyone in the way
i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features
and try to show out on a track with me
but it'd actually have to be
a fuckin' blowout to get me to retire
tell these new artists that kings never die
i know shit has changed in this age fuck a twitter page
did it just say i've been upstaged
why am i online it's driving me crazy
i'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
on what's hot but i'm not one to conform
but as days pass in this shit
and opinions sway i can hear 'em say
if i stay passionate maybe i can stage a miraculous
comeback as if i went away
but detractors just say so much for the renegade
someone's gonna make me blow my composure
here i go again center stage and i feel like i'm in a cage
they so want a champion to fall
it's no wonder why i laugh at 'em
â€˜cause why can't we win 'em all
so fuck what these cynics say
it just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
and i'm under attack again that i'll act as if i'm 'posed ta
with this pentup rage â€˜cause all these plaques in my office
on the floor stacked against the door
are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again
â€˜cause all the accomplishments accolades awards
and trophies just don't mean jack anymore
if i'm here today and gone tomorrow and i'm not gonna beâ€¦

here to stay
even when i'm gone
when i close my eyes
through the passage of time
kings never die

i want it i'm comin' to get it
so you son of a bitches don't duck
youâ€™re gonna get riddick boweâ€™d
critics'll end up in critical
think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
and i ain't stopping 'til i'm on top again
all alone and on a throne like a token of respect
or a homage poem or an ode i've been owed
tossed in the air by my own arm
and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
and when it's my time to go
i'm still not leaving stop for no one i don't know
but i've been told an obstacle that blocks your road
knock it over time to go for the pot of gold â€˜causeâ€¦

they say kings never die
just ask jam master jay
they just grow wings and they fly
so hands up reach for the sky
try to hold on and prolong these moments
â€˜cause in a blink of an eye
they'll be over

tryna secure your legacy like shakur
and ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
so before you're leavin' this earth
you want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
deacon of words syllable genius at work
plus i'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness kill 'em with meanness
i went from powdered milk and farina
to flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
at gilbert's to arenas call me gilbert arenas
still appeal to the dreamers
i made it to the silverscreen
but rocky's still what the theme is
khalil on the beat â€˜cause makin' the beat
ainâ€™t the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
it's that soundbombing thirstin' howl
common underground diamond d outsidaz
stomach growl throbbin' hunger outrhymin' everyone
god just give me one shot i swear that i won't let you down
i'ma be around foreverandaday even in the ground
you ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say i ain'tâ€¦

here to stay
even when i'm gone
when i close my eyes
through the passage of time
kings never die

kings never die
i own a mansion but live in a house
a kingsize bed but i sleep on the couch
i'm mr brightside glass is halffull
but my tank's half empty gasket just blew

this always happens
thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin
only option i have's mcdonalds's bathroom
in a public stall droppin' a football
so every time someone walks in the john i get maddened
shady what up what come on man i'm crappin'
and you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin
oh that's odd i just happened
to run out of tissue yeah hand me that
on second thought i'd be glad then
thanks dawg name's todd a big fan
i wiped my ass with it
crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
told him todd you're the shit when's all of this crap end
can't pump my gas without causing an accident
pump my gas cut my grass i can't take out the fuckin' trash
without someone passin' through my sub harassin'
i'd count my blessings but i suck at math
i'd rather wallow than bask sufferin' succotash
but the antacid it gives my stomach gas
when i mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
potatoes so what ho kiss my country bumpkin ass
missouri southern roots what the fuck is upper class
call lunch dinner call dinner supper
tupperware in the cupboard plasticware up the ass
stuck in the past â€“ ipod what the fuck is that
bboy to the core mule i'm as stubborn as

maybe that's why i feel so strange
got it all but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave detroit
it's the motivation that keeps me goin'
this is the inspiration i need
i can never turn my back on the city that made me
and life's been good to me so far

they call me classless i heard that i second and third that
don't know what the fuck i'd be doin' if it weren't rap
probably be a giant turd sack
but i blew never turned back
turned 40 and still sag â€“ teenagers act more fuckin' mature jack
fuck you gonna say to me i leave on my own terms asshole
i'm goin' berzerk my nerves are bad
but i love the perks my work has
i get to meet famous people look at her dag
her nylons are ran her skirt's snagged
and i heard she dragraces burp swag
tuck in my hanes shirt tag
you're danica patrick yeah word skag
we'd be the perfect match
'cause you're a vacuum i'm a dirtbag
my apologies no disrespect to technology
but what the heck is all of these buttons
you expect me to sit here and learn that
fuck i gotta do to hear this new song from luda
be an expert at computers
i'd rather be an encyclopedia birtannica hell with
playstation i'm still on my first man on some zelda
nintendo bitch run jump punch stab and i melt the
mozzarella on my spaghetti
put in on bread make a sandwich with welch's and belch
they say this spray butter is bad for my health but
i think this poor white trash from the trailer
jed clampett fred sanford and welfare
mentality helps to keep me grounded
that's why i never take full advantage of wealth i
managed to dwell within these parameters
still crammin' the shelves full of hamburger helper
i can't even help it this is the hand i was dealt a
creature of habit feel like i'm trapped in an animal shelter
with all these pet peeves goddamn it to hell i
can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
i can't go anywhere i get so mad i could yell the
other day someone got all elaborate
and stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
went to burger king they spit on my onion rings
i think my karma is catchin' up with me

maybe that's why i feel so strange
got it all but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave detroit
it's the motivation that keeps me goin'
this is the inspiration i need
i can never turn my back on the city that made me
and life's been good to me so far

got friends on facebook all over the world
not sure what that means they tell me it's good
so i'm artist of the decade i even got a plaque
i'd hang it up but the frame is all cracked

i'm tryin' to be lowkey hopefully nobody notices me
in produce hunched over giant nosebleed
ogre style as i mosey over to the frozen aisle
by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
embarrassed i just did comerica with hova
the show's over i'm hidin' in kroger buyin' groceries
he just had frontrow seats
told me to sign this poster then insults me
wow up close didn't know you had crow's feet
i'm in the crossroads lost still shoppin' at costco's
sloppy joe's bulk waffles
got caught picking my nose agh
look over see these two hot hoes
finger still up one of my nostrils
right next to 'em stuck at the light the fuckin' shit's
takin' forever to change it's stuck these bitches are lovin' it
rubbin' it in chucklin' couldn't do nothin'
play it off what you bumpin'
trunk muzik yelawolf's better fuckin' bitch
they want me to flip at the label but i won't succumb to it
the pressure they want me to follow up with
another one after recovery was so highly coveted
but what good is a fuckin' recovery if i fumble it
'cause i'ma drop the ball if i don't get a grip
hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
wrong subdivision to fuck with bitch
quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
i love my city but you pushed me to the limit â€“ what a pity
the shit i complain about
it's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin' out
koolaid stain on the couch i'll never get it out
but bitch i got an elevator in my house
ants and a mouse â€“ i'm livin' the dream

maybe that's why i feel so strange
got it all but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave detroit
it's the motivation that keeps me goin'
this is the inspiration i need
i can never turn my back on the city that made me
and life's been good to me so far

i wanna dig my way to hell
i wanna dig my way to hell
i'm getting by with my wicked ways
i'm loading up and i'm taking names
i wanna dig my way to hell
i wanna dig my way to hell

guess i got a way with words i could get away with murder
ever heard of aspergers' it's a rare condition
it's what you're sufferin' from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no frickin' air conditionin'
and you can't see the bitchâ€™s hair is frizzin'
'cause you got the windows up blarin' the system
in your chevrolet prizm
the devil ain't on a level same as him
picture someone who revels in straight masochism
and imagine him givin' an adjective an asswhoopin'
so bad they should put his ass in prison
a word bully i verbally abuse verbs
like they did somethin' to me personally
used to get bullied so i'd cut class and ditch it
now i bully rap i'm the shit faggot sniff it
cadillac from a k car
my ass from a hole in the ground still canâ€™t tell 'em apart
came straight out the trailer park
screamin' i'm proud to shop at kmart and it became art
and i'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
to this day i still get in fights with the same broad
at the same walmart arguin' over the same cart
in the middle of the aisle whilin' i don't give a fuck i don't play
bitch you think you saw this basket first
you're ass backwards like motherfuckin' bob and silent jay
illest shit you could think i would say
mind's like a pile of clay
when's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
ripped a gapin' hole in it flipped out
ripped down the drapes tied 'em around my neck
went down the fire escape of the empire state
slipped fell straight down to the ground
splattered all over the entire state
and straight to hell got impaled by the gates
saw satan stuck his face in an ashtray
while i sashayed around flames with a match
and i gave him the gas face
and this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale
or being gay little faggot but by the way
thoughts are gettin' darker by the day
i'm a combination of skylar grey
tyler the creator and violent j
it's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
i'm insane every rhyme i say
sons you like an ultraviolet ray
iâ€™m sellin' hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat
1199 so come on and pile a plate
iâ€™m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell i can raise
with the rhyme iâ€™m spittin' while iâ€™m shittin' on competition
in the meantime itâ€™s always mean time i'm gettin'â€”

i'm getting by with my wicked ways
i'm loading up and i'm taking names
i wanna dig my way to hell
i wanna dig my way to hell
i'm getting by with my wicked ways
i'm loading up and i'm taking names
i wanna dig my way to hell
i wanna dig my way to hell

iâ€™ve been a career asshole
i donâ€™t see why these people always got my back
i done said so much fucked up shit
i was born a mistake but i was put here not by accident
i had a purpose and that purpose
was to beat a beat purplish slaughter tracks
i done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
iâ€™m comin' to get that quarter back
like ndamukong the drama can build
your mama can ask me for my autograph
'cause that cougar's a milf
she's the oldest trick in the book but i sure would fall for that
you done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
when i get on the mic i'ma snap
make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
when i overdosed woulda caught a flat
if it makes you sick to your stomach acid
indigestion my suggestionâ€™s kaopectate
if it feels like i'm runnin' away with the game
it's 'cause i am don't speculate spectate
all i got is dick for days and insults for decades
but i get by with my wicked ways
lady you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
cry 'til you get puffy eyes red faced
but i'm leavin' on this jet plane
you ain't fly you're an airhead
and i'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
sorry another catchphrase
but your baggage ain't gon' fit in my storage overhead space
'cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'cause baby stable mentally i ain't
i need my meds i peed my bed
i'm going blind i don't see my legs i keep on falling down
no wonder you can't stand me i need my cane
someone help me i think my face is melting
if you felt these migraines
and see these maggots eat my brain
this giant hole in my empty head
if you read my mind you can see my pain
and you'd see why i be this way
ever since i was kneehigh playin' with gi joes
told these hoes shut their pie holes now peep my game
'cause i'm 'bout it 'bout it
like a fuckin' fuckin' echo echo
psych psycho on a cyclone cycle spiralin' here i go
i'm outta control like no other mic go
stab you 'til the knife goes â€“ dull
i'm nothin' but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'cause i'ma sock it to you
dyke ho you don't like it
get on your harley davidson menstrual cycle
and ride it like a motorbike
i'm finna blow the mic the whole night so
strike up the fuckin' maestro i'm nitro
and hi ho hand me my shovel
i'm liable to dig my hole deeper
and it's off to he double hockey sticks i go

i'm getting by with my wicked ways
i'm loading up and i'm taking names
i wanna dig my way to hell
i wanna dig my way to hell
i'm getting by with my wicked ways
i'm loading up and i'm taking names
i wanna dig my way to hell
i wanna dig my way to hell

ohh please be empty
please be empty please be empty
thank you god
shitâ€¦ is that a girl
i'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
and get my balls blew out and get gay into the am
and lay with eighteen guys naked
and let myself show let myself show
buttfuck it suck it pull it tug it
life's too short to not stroke your bone
so everybody everybody
circle jerk touch my body
who is that where are you going come back
why does everyone always leave me
hello fuck you then
blow it out your ass
i am phenomenal
with every ounce of my blood
with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm phenomenal
i am phenomenal
however long that it takes
i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
i am phenomenal
but i'll never say â€˜oh itâ€™s impossibleâ€™
cause i'm born to be phenomenal

unstoppable unpoppable thought bubbles
untoppable thoughts fuckin' juggernaut that'll
stomp you in a verse obstacles i'm drawn to 'em
when the going got rough
some of what i done fought through was the worst little sissy
who the fuck taught you how to persevere
there ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
the messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
yeah i don't try like hell then i might as well
hang it up like a shelf gotta keep growin' with it evolve
cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
but you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
time to slip in that zone 'til i find myself
inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
into waters where nobody else has gone before
or willing to go uncharted feeling is so
bomb i'm feelin' myself i'm a giant
sometimes i gotta remind myself that i am

i am phenomenal
with every ounce of my blood
with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm phenomenal
i am phenomenal
however long that it takes
i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
i am phenomenal
but i'll never say â€˜oh itâ€™s impossibleâ€™
cause i'm born to be phenomenal

let me selfempower you
when you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
and you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
i'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
convert it to gunpowder too
now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
put the spark to it like martha stewart barbecuing
ah screw it feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
punch through it just cock back put your all into it
now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
never take back what you say
if you stay strapped in your brain engaged in a steel cage match
ready to scrap asap
take your fists and just ball it
show who's big and who's smallest you're christopher wallace
now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
lays flat where you put your dinner plates at
and set it on 'em like a placemat
i am phenomenal
and i want you to say that

i am phenomenal
with every ounce of my blood
with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm phenomenal
i am phenomenal
however long that it takes
i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
i am phenomenal
but i'll never say â€˜oh itâ€™s impossibleâ€™
cause i'm born to be phenomenal

oh step into the unknown and find yourself
youâ€™re floating freely no emotion

got a fuckinâ€™ mouth with no shutoff valve
can't even cut off power to it but it's what allowed
me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
cause i worked my butt off now
it's a subject that i don't know how to shut up about
cause i stuck it out
like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
i responded when i got shoved around
you're gonna have nonbelievers
but when you're beyond belief you probably shouldn't wonder how
get it how you live
but are you prepared to give more than you get
and put in twice what you get back from this shit
though what you sacrifice barely is half never give
rap is my shiv
but it's like my shield at the same time i wield and my knife is will
sometimes i feel just like b real from cypress hill
how i can just kill a cypher survivor's guilt
i rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
ready to face any challenge waitin'
can taste it it's salivation i'm wagin' retaliation
look what i have built reputation is validation
the only thing i'm capable of makin' is amazing
only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
or accusation i am legendary status in fact
that is the only way you'll ever be able to say
you're a legend is makin' an allegation
i write with the left same hand i hold the mic with
as i fight to the death 'til my last breath
manage to prove who the best man is
prevail at all costs be the only ones left standin'
in the end but i ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
cause i am

i am phenomenal
with every ounce of my blood
with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm phenomenal
i am phenomenal
however long that it takes
i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
i am phenomenal
but i'll never say â€˜oh itâ€™s impossibleâ€™
cause i'm born to be phenomenal
when i was just a little baby boy
my momma used to tell me these crazy things
she used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
she used to tell me he hated me
but then i got a little bit older
and i realized she was the crazy one
but there was nothing i could do or say to try to change it
â€˜cause that's just the way she was

to do it again then if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
bitch i'ma kill you i ain't done this ain't the chorus

i take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
and if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
scratches my name is slim shady
i been crazy way before radio didn't play me
the sensational scratch back is the incredible
with ken kaniff who just finds the men edible
it's ken kaniff on the internet
tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
it's a sick world we live in these days
slim for pete's sakes put down christopher reeve's legs
geez you guys are so sensitive
slim it's a touchy subject try and just don't mention it
mind with no sense in it fried schizophrenic
whose eyes get so squinted
i'm blind from smoke in 'em with my windows tinted
with nine limos rented doin' lines of coke in 'em
with a bunch of guys hoppin' out all high and indo scented
and that's where i get my name from that's why they call meâ€”

that's why they call me slim shady
i'm back i'm back

â€˜cause i'mmmm shady they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole y2k thing
and by the way n'sync why do they sing

lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings
it's why i tend to block out when i hear things
â€˜cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring ahh
so i just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that i was stickin' it to christina
â€˜cause if i ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
it'd be jennifer lopez â€” and puffy you know this
i'm sorry puff but i don't give a fuck
if this chick was my own mother

and have a son and a new brother at the same time

slim shady 2001
i'm blew out from this blunt sighs fuck
welcome to detroit
this is the bet shady 20 cypher 2011
myself slaughterhouse and yelawolf
white dawg get 'em
thank you cracker king

put these mothafuckas in a box then i send 'em away
put 'em in a gray 'llac and pop the trunk
and throw 'em in the back jack ha dig 'em a grave
put a brick inside that xerox when i print up a page
movin' keys i can relate 'cause i live in the cage
i throw up the a i take 'em to school i give 'em a grade
an easy e for effort that's wwa
white with an attitude alphabet soup is on my plate
all i got is z's they sleepin' on me i can't get 'em awake
i spoonfeed 'em a sound in a room full of deceivers and clowns
who believe in makin' it rain 'cause all they see is the clouds
and i watch from the couch of the vip like a potato
with a bunch of meatheads like fuck it i'll just feed 'em a cow
plenty of white boys to pick from this year
but before you pick a pepper you better pick up your heater
'cause even peter piper could pick up a mic
but what it's like to pick a fight with me
is like puttin' nikes on a cheetah
better speed up or at least in my case adidas
i'm out this bitch drinkin' sprite by the twoliter
holler shady recordsâ€¦

say i'm from the new school
i'ma say check your tone and watch your mouth
if they teachin' how to dougie i'm condonin' droppin' out
forced to wild y'all birthed me then gave me up
i just perfected being hiphop's foster child now check it
don't blame y'all for being trash fans are coppin' it
the radio's the crime scene the masses are the hostages
in my youth i'd throw shots the fad was dodgin' it
i'm grown i ain't watchin' the throne i'm sabotagin' it
you see that fourheaded monster in the storm looms
snipe 'em from a distance the scope got a long zoom
you super mario thugs is in the wrong room
gotta figure here you won't get bigger if you on shrooms
if it was left to me i'd revive what the game be 'bout
i'd have took the wine outta amy house
enough raps from you scrub cats 'bout cockin' a snub back
wayne couldn't teach me how to love that
but i got this chick from uptown she my summer bunny
both parents broke but she come from money
think my bread is her paper to burn
so i lock her out and now she doubt david is stern
she's so bad i make her hit the telly from a taxi
then dead her in the holiday inn learned that from max b
that's why the haters envy kinda wanna send me llamas
i made it right before their eyes like i was benihanas
is it me or is what i'm hearing just pitiful
airwaves the same now the stereo's typical
my skin's thick so the critics ignored
so unafraid to die you'd think i did it before
the boy's rodman with the trash talk
magic or walt with the black ball
way i bounce off the asphalt with cat paws glass jaw
hood of your mask will be the blackfoot with no passport
body be found in a mansion in one of my trapdoors
if punks had award you status whores categore
probably be that of awards
between michael rappaport and kenny lattimore
i know hiphop's alive and well
if it died you other crews wouldn't survive the smell

i spot a victim the plot'll thicken when the clock is tickin'
i caught him slippin' i gotta give him a shot i hit him
with proper spittin' hottest writtens and compositions
so competition's a contradiction
somebody mention they got a crooked highly fiction
we probly different got gotti henchmen
opposition i'll body quick as bugatti engines
i'm on a mission to get richer the sickest lyrickicker
diggin' a ditch for different spitters
weak lyricists get disfigured
sip liquor spit like a sick mixture
of notorious pun and l get the big picture
the poster i'll roast ya
my mind so deadly it's just like the beanie is close to a holster
it's over control my whole coastal region
like i'm supposed to flow is goin' postal even
open season heart close to freezin'
ruthless as eazy nigga approach i'm squeezin'
believe me dopest westcoaster breathin'
so most y'all hope i'm vegan nope i'm beefin'
rappers need to keep it trill give me a beat to kill
too many people still eatin' sleeping pills
people sleepin' on my ether skills
and y'all ain't even real you 'bout to die in this cypher
before you die you should do the jada and leave a will for real

i ain't a rap dude i'm a dude who rap
before this i was movin' crack
killers y'all become when y'all rhyme i salute and dap
and if i blink they'll remove your snaps
you ain't cool you wack with your foolish act
skinny jeans don't mean your ass shoot
it means your booty claps
don't play like tyler perry
this the slaughterhouse of pain flow brown tight and heavy
when it come to 16's i'm a fiend
seen in the studio near a needle with a mean lean
probably writin' bars to nas' thief's theme
gettin' my yaowa on
man all these olajuwons we the dream team
this is an all day slaughter
they fiendin' for us to break like beyonce's water
the four quarters doin' all the eatin'
and y'all gotta know why i made the cut i'm puerto rican
ortiz keep the fire ready and tryin' to put me out
is like tryin' to steal a transvestite from eddie

i'm doordie dope and you can make the sticker sittin' on the door of that phantom your suicide note
hi rihanna is nicki livin' with you
let me know so i can buy binoculars and telescopes
hi rihanna i don't need to know you better
you tell me you love my music again we go together
bye rihanna now back to y'all fools
we rock out like the outside of a guitar school
thousand dollar frames i prefer to see the world through
don't ask me nothin' about budden i beat my girl too
you ask me why do i keep her i say it's cheaper to
that's why i ride around in a rolls like wiz khalifa do
rappers i'm your daddy i tell you straight as this
you don't kill but your father will like jayden smith
i tell you like i tell my spanish chick
you fly but i ain't going down on no landin' strip
so get your wax on like daniel san or i'ma have to run
like de la hoya in drag when cameras come
point out the greatest rapper alive i'll headshot him
smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom
bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
while i'm cybersexin' with jessica alba via skype
iâ€™m on my dboy deebo thing
spiritual steelo swing like ceelo green
get out the camera with your broll bling
you know your flow is wack
we cornered the market like a walmart in a culdesac
yeah this is what two million singles sold
and an album that's gold
look like without having to sell your soul
nickel

ayo lyrical miracle spiritual individual criminal
subliminal in your swimming poolâ€¦ boooooo
you're 'bout to see peace destroyed it'll never be restored
when i unleash these beastly hordes on your cd stores
wanna stop it you gon' need a priest at least three swords
a license to ill from the beastie boys
three ouija boards a squeegee and please be warned
don't ask what the squeegee's for
or the holy water acid raps that'll eat these floors
eat a hole in a rhyme book you see these horns
and as for me you ask when i'm gone will he be mourned
is puke lukewarm should casey anthony do porn
can that chick fit a newborn dead baby inside a frickin' shoebox with a shoehorn
smothered in chloroform so she can go get her groove on
can she ducttape and velcro a fetus
joell yo tell joe i need his
empty box from his old shelltoed adidas
so i can put these babies in a fetal position
they're gettin' elbows to the penis
yeah big deal i took some little kid's big wheel
and spit in his frickin' big kids meal
quit tryna bite me and pinch you wench sit still
did you just put your sixinch heel
through my benz windshield
is it dust we 'bout to kick up
can yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup
between his stick shift in his frigging pickup
and drink like a hick redneck hillbilly will 'til he gets hiccups
flippin' the script up like mike vick
gettin' bit in his junk by a pit yup i'm a sick pup
i'd be a horrible magician 'cause i'd fuck a trick up
fix your lips up to say somethin' fly or zip up
aye b let's see you said you were gonna do xyz
'til you fuck around and get dropped
like an e when you add an ing
don't put a k in front of that though when i mc
'cause i'm not the king of this microphone booth
it's more like a phone booth
superman in this bitch kryptonite won't do
it gives me more power
i bump the fat boys and eat rat poison take meteor showers
fresh outta the mental hospital
and me not flossin' a middle finger while i hop in a mosh pit
will be like nas doin' gospel or rbâ€”you crazy
me pushin' up daisies that thought is impossible
as if flashin' across the news
posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
with a huge johnson boobs and a monstrous tube
of lube and a bra some boots

in the lobby of the intercontinental with an obvious intent
and i would not even relent
up on a little like osama with a bomb under the bin
and down the middle of the pentagon
and hit a kindergartener with a rental stop
back and forth back and forth
like jack kevorkian's ass to court
rap mature why can't you be like macklemore huh

not as raw as i was â€œ'walk on water' sucksâ€

brain's a powder keg i draw inspiration outta hate
real pain in the paper i don't trace

who can say for sure perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer if science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use society would reap a great benefit

i walk around like a space cadet place your bets
who's likely to become a serial killer case of tourettes
fuck fuckfuck can't take the stress
i make a mess as the day progresses
angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
like this is how i'll cut your face up bitches
with these hedgetrimmin' scissors with razor edges
imagination's dangerous
it's the only way to escape this mess
and make the best of this situation i guess
'cause i feel like a little bitch
this predicament's despicable i'm sick of just gettin' pushed
it's ridiculous i look like a frickin' wuss
a pussy this kid just took my stick of licorice
and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
i wanna kick his tush but i was six and shook
this fucker was twelve and was six foot with a vicious hook
he hit me i fell i got back up all i did was book
now there's using your head momma always saidâ€”

fast forward some years later a teenager this is fun sweet
i just got jumped twice in one week it's complete
it's usually once a month this is some feat
i've accomplished they've stomped me
into the mud gee for what reason you stumped me
but how do you get the shit beat out of you
beat down and be upbeat when you don't have nothing
no valid shot at life chance to make it or succeed
'cause you're doomed from the start
it's like you grew up on jump street from jump street
but if i could just get my head out my ass
i could accomplish any task practicin' trashtalkin'
in a trance locked in my room
yeah but i got some plans momma
these damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket
i can't stop it and i'm starting to blend in more
in school this shit helps for sure
i'm getting more selfassured than i've ever been before
plus no one picks on me anymore
i done put a stop to that threw my first punch â€“ end of story
still in my skullâ€™s a vacant empty void
been usinâ€™ it more as a bin for storage
take some inventory in this gourde thereâ€™s a ford engine
door hinge syringe an orange
an extension cord and a ninja sword
not to mention four linchpins an astringent stored
ironinâ€™ board a bench a wrench a ore
wench an attention whore
everything but a brain
but dome's off the fuckin' chain like an independent store
something's wrong with my head
just think if i had a brain in it thank god that i don't
'cause i'd probably be dahmer 'cause momma always saidâ€”

if you had a brain you'd be dangerous
a brain you'd be dangerous
i'ma prove you wrong
momma i'ma grow one day to be famous
and i'ma be a pain in the anus
i'ma be the bomb
i'ma use my head as a weapon
find a way to escape this insaneness

inappropriate so be it i don't see it
maybe one day when the smoke clears it won't be as
motherfuckin' difficult chyeah
'til then hopefully you little homos
get over your fears and phobias
it's okay to be scared straight
they said i provoke queers 'til emotions evoke tears
my whole career's a stroke of sheer genius
smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes yeah
you motherfuckin' insert insult here
who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ol' mc'd
be able to take the whole culture and reupholstery it
and boy they did flock can't believe this little hick locked
this hiphop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
that whitetrash traffic in gridlock

du
america ha ha ha we love you
how many people are proud to be citizens
of this beautiful country of ours the stripes and the stars
for the rights that men have died for to protect
the women and men who have broke their necks
for the freedom of speech the united states government has sworn to upholdâ€¦â or so we're told
yo i want everybody to listen to the words of this song

i never would've dreamed in a million years i'd see
so many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
it's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
so many lives i touched so much anger aimed
in no particular direction just sprays and sprays
and straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
who would've thought standin' in this mirror bleachin' my hair
with some peroxide reachin' for a tshirt to wear
that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this
how could i predict my words would have an impact like this
i must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'cause congress keep tellin' me i ain't causin' nothin' but problems
and now they're sayin' i'm in trouble with the government
i'm lovin' it i shoveled shit all my life and now i'm dumpin' it on

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get
white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get

look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
if they were brown shady'd lose shady sits on the shelf
but shady's cute shady knew shady's dimples would help
make ladies swoon baby ooh baby â€” look at my sales
let's do the math if i was black i woulda sold half
i ain't have to graduate from lincoln high school to know that
but i could rap so fuck school i'm too cool to go back
give me the mic show me where the fuckin' studio's at
when i was underground no one gave a fuck i was white
no labels wanted to sign me almost gave up i was like
fuck it until i met dre the only one to look past
gave me a chance and i lit a fire up under his ass
helped him get back to the top every fan black that i got
was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
like damn we just swapped sittin' back lookin' at shit wow
i'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get
white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get

see the problem is i speak to suburban kids
who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
whose moms probly woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'til i created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
straight out the tube right into your livin' rooms i came
and kids flipped when they knew i was produced by dre
that's all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
and they connected with me too because i looked like them
that's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
searchin' with a fine tooth comb it's like this rope
waitin' to choke tightenin' around my throat
watchin' me while i write this like i don't like this note
all i hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy
sponsors working round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
surely hiphop was never a problem in harlem only in boston
after it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
so now i'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
actin' like i'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot shit
just look at me like i'm your closest pal
the posterchild the motherfuckin' spokesman now forâ€”

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get
white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get

so to the parents of america i am the derringer
aimed at little erica to attack her character
the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
and piss on the lawns of the white house
to burn the â€‹â€‹flagâ€‹â€‹ and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
to spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
fuck you ms cheney fuck you tipper gore
fuck you with the freest of speech this divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have fuck you
ha ha ha i'm just playin' america
you know i love you
aw yeah it's like this like this
it's eminem baby
back up in that motherfuckin' ass
till forever till forever
one time for your motherfuckin' mind for mc's mc's
we represent the 313â€”you know what iâ€™m sayin'
yo they donâ€™t know shit about this for the '96

ayo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
to get your brain relaxin' the zany actin' maniac in action
a brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction
you look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
my rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
i travel through your mind and to your spine like siren drills
i'm slimin' grills of roaches with spray that disinfects
and twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
put this in decks and check the monologue
turn your system up twist 'em up
and indulge in the marijuana smog
this is the season for noise pollution contamination
examination of more cartunes than animation
my lamination of narerration hits a snare and bass
on a track for duck rapper interrogation
when i declare invasion there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
i turn the stage into a barren wasteland i'm infinite

you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it servin' a sentence
for murderin' instruments
now i'm tryin' to repent from it
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted
to make another attempt at it i'm infinite

bust it i let the beat commence
so i can beat the sense in your elite defense
i got some meat to mince
a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
i greet the gents and ladies i spoil loyal fans
i foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
one thought in my cerebral
is deeper than a jeepfull of people
mc's are feeble i came to cause some pandemonium
battle a band of phony mc's and stand the lonely one
imitator intimidator stimulator
simulator of data eliminator
there's never been a greater since the burial of jesus
fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
my thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
my a cappella releases classic masterpieces
through telekinesis it eases you mentally
gently sentimentally instrumentally
with entity dementedly meant to be infinite

you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it servin' a sentence
for murderin' instruments
now i'm tryin' to repent from it
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted
to make another attempt at it i'm infinite

man i got evidence i'm never dense
and i've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
to do some shit that represents the mo
so i'm assumin' all responsibility
â€˜cause there's a monster will in me
that always wants to kill mc's
mic nestler slammin' like a wrestler
here to make a mess of a lyricsmugglin' embezzler
no one is specialer my skill is intergalactical
i get cynical act a fool
then i send a crew back to school
i never packed a tool or acted cool it wasn't practical
i'd rather let a tactical tactful track tickle your fancy
in fact i can't see or can't imagine
a man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
so this is for my family the kid who had a cameo
on my last jam plus the man who never had a plan b
be all you can be â€˜cause once you make an instant hit
i'm tensed a bit and tempted
when i see the sins my friends commit i'm infinite

you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it servin' a sentence
for murderin' instruments
now i'm tryin' to repent from it
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted
to make another attempt at it i'm infinite

'95 '96 '96
and on and on and on and on and on
you claim if you get knocked by the cops
you'll give 'em not even a statement
walk in the arraignment
shoot the bailiff karate kick the plaintiff
gotti with the stainless
i'll just call it shoddy entertainment
if y'all was in the party gettin' faded
on molly had the audience sedated
you wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
probably let it fall and hit the pavement
but you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
bitch stop bein' a lame
your hobby isnâ€™t robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
like you was tommy lynn sells
and chainsawin' them in the basement
hardly fits your job description
ain't nobody dippin'
out the back of the club like oh my god he's trippin'
only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment ain't it
wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
i need to stop bein' debated
you're still copyin' xeroxing i'm still copping a feel
like bill cosby at will popping a pill
then spill oxys in jill's coffee
then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
this blonde fuck's reprehensible
misconducts never sensible
kiss my butt my set of principles
is gone but till i get the president to respond
my pen and pencil is a missile launcher
and send it to mitch mcconnell
just as big of a bitch as donaldâ€”shit's on bruh haha
let me sing this shit soprano
while i do it pizzicato
ivanka stiff arm her while i'm hittin' on melania
and this song's for all ya

'cause nobody likes me everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms
i hope you offended
and drag my name through the mud through the dirt
but i'ma make you eat your words
i hope you offended
you can try to hold me down but you better let me up
'cause you're only gonna make things worse
i hope you offended
'cause i swear when i get up i'm never gonna let up
till everybody eats my turds

these drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
like justin ross harris at a nursery
goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
i'm gettin' handies with the zanny xannys in the caddy armrest
i'm imagining objects
so i'm batting cobwebs from a daddy longleg
in hamtramck got the panoramic camera
xanax a banana hammock and a santa hat
i'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
with a chick that looks like janet jackson with a spanish accent
twice her age and i'm actin' half it haha
grow up nah not that i know of y'all
basement just got a frickin' overhaul
got a stripper pole installed
started rollin' all through those klonopins like a bowlin' ball
like an overdose on twice the ratio of propofol
and go through no withdrawal
while i get fellatio and give a facial to
an interracial blowup doll of rachel dolezal
you're so appalled emâ€¦ so's my manager
bitch i am mature fuck a pro career
coast is clear but nowhere to go from here
and nobody's close so don't compare
they ain't nowhere near i'm way over here
my competition can't see meâ€”'cause i don't own a mirror
but marshall you are terrific so smart and gifted
i'm so narcissistic when i fart i sniff it
do a fake dab to smell my armpits whiff it
your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
but i made strides with these rape lines
i'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
like ray rice when he facetimes
bang bang bang bang time
dang knives're butcher than gay wives
you're gonna need sutures the same size
as the blade i push into caput'cha
when i pull 'em likeâ€¦â what sleigh rides
gotta stab a bitch at least eight times to make it on dateline
i came to stake my claim like a canine waitin' in a buffet line
so kellyanne conway i'm a really bad hombre
come play belly dance on me
i've been making wedding plans all day

'cause nobody likes me everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms
i hope you offended
and drag my name through the mud through the dirt
but i'ma make you eat your words
i hope you offended
you can try to hold me down but you better let me up
'cause you're only gonna make things worse
i hope you offended
'cause i swear when i get up i'm never gonna let up
till everybody eats my turds

eightyearold with the wordplay
girl take this pole like a survey
today wasn't my birthday
but i'm caked up like a dessert tray
so we're in shape 'cause you're in a slurrin' state
iâ€™m a ten youâ€™re an eight
like what i do before after and durin' rape
you wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better
and be made a fool out of when i pull on 'em
r kelly with a full bladder
nonhigh school grad i'm not a scholar
but i'm so cold when i'm droppin' knowledge
my degrees is the same as i got in college zero
but nobody's hotter you owe me my respect
i owe you nada like haloti partner
blow me told you i'm so dirty homie
you can throw me in some holy water
with some floaties on and get the soap and try to
get the pope to hold me while you hose me off
and nope i won't be washed
you hope to god i don't explode
i gotta blow this spot up though i got a lotta mo'
i won't put the sugar coating on it though
'cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
rap's got you drained dead tired zapped
you feel like a wet pile of crap
but look man like the feds buggin' my phone
uh huh i get why you're tapped
but you gotta get your fire back
catch fire get upset and fire back
is what i tell myself when times get bad
'cause sometimes i might get sad
but i take the same advice i had
and tell myself like i used to tell hailie when life's a drag
told her to do like her dad don't cry get mad
'cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
i'm hyper by the time you see this side of me
i'm right in your ass sodomy
foot up it i stood up for the kid
who had to put up with the bullies at his school at his school
you ain't have to have no money
or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude attitude
now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
it's rised too high to count it
never asked to be rich all i did was wish
i had a dime for every time that i was doubted
but then i think about it then i'm enraged
'cause i just figured out that if i was paid
for the time i spent to put the pen to the page
it'd be minimum wage
but it's embedded in my head i never
hunted for the bread and butter
what i wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
i'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
i put up in the pen and when i'm dead i wonder
will they put me on a pedestal
or forget i was ever this incredible
i guess i better go harder than ever 'cause
i'll never get another mothafuckin' opportunity again
to offend as many people with this i can simply because i can

'cause nobody likes me everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms
i hope you offended
and drag my name through the mud through the dirt
but i'ma make you eat your words
i hope you offended
you can try to hold me down but you better let me up
'cause you're only gonna make things worse
i hope you offended
'cause i swear when i get up i'm never gonna let up
till everybody eats my turds

smoke weed take pills drop out of school kill people
and drink jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
i'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal

i slapped garth brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
i'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
that'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
my rap style's warped i'm running out the morgue
with your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
jumped in a chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
and beat up foghorn leghorn with an acorn
i'm 'bout as normal as norman bates with deformative traits
a premature birth that was four minutes late
mother are you there i love you
i never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
will someone please explain to my brain
that i just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and i'm in pain
i take a breather and sigh either i'm high
or i'm nuts â€˜cause if you ain't tilting this room neither am i
so when you see your mom with a thermometer
shoved in her ass then it probably is obvious i got it on with her

what you say what's wrong didn't think i'd remember
i'ma kill you mothafucka uhhahh temper temper
mr dre mr nwa mr ak
comin' straight outta compton y'all better make way
how in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent

â€˜cause he don't need to go the same route that i went
been there done that
aw fuck it what am i sayin'
shoot 'em both grady where's your gun at
gunshots
too late for the other side
caught in a chase 25 to life
too late for the other side
caught in a chase 25 to life
too late
i can't keep chasing 'em
i'm taking my life back
caught in a chase 25 to life

i don't think she understands the sacrifices that i've made
maybe if this bitch had acted right i woulda stayed
but i've already wasted over half my life i woulda laid
down and died for you i no longer cry for you no more pain
bitch you took me for granted
took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
into the dirt i can no longer stand it
now my respect i demand it
i'ma take control of this relationship command it
and i'ma be the boss of you now goddamn it
and what i mean is that i will no longer let you control me
so you better hear me out this much you owe me
i gave up my life for you totally devoted to you i have stayed
faithful all the way this is how i fuckin' get repaid
look at how i dress fuckin' baggy sweats go to work a mess
always in a rush to get back to you i ain't heard you yet
not even once say you appreciate me i deserve respect
i've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
and i know that if i end this i'll no longer have nothin' left
but you keep treatin' me like a staircase it's time to fuckin' step
and i won't be comin' back so don't hold your fuckin' breath
you know what you've done no need to go in depth
i told you you'd be sorry if i fuckin' left
i laughed while you wept how's it feel now
yeah funny ain't it you neglected me
did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
but a special place for you in my heart i have kept
it's unfortunate but it'sâ€¦

too late for the other side
caught in a chase 25 to life
can't take no more
too late for the other side
caught in a chase 25 to life

i feel like when i bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
â€˜cause that ain't good enough
you expect me to fold myself in half 'til i snap
don't think i'm loyal all i do is rap
how can i moonlight on the side i have no life outside of that
don't i give you enough of my time
you don't think so do you
jealous when i spend time with the girls
why i'm married to you still man i don't know
but tonight i'm serving you with papers
i'm divorcing you â€“ go marry someone else and make 'em famous
and take away their freedom like you did to me
treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
i'm moving on forget you
oh now i'm special i ain't feel special when i was with you
all i ever felt was this helplessness
imprisoned by a selfish bitch
chew me up and spit me out i fell for this
so many times it's ridiculous
and still i stick with this i'm sick of this
but in my sickness and addiction you're addictive as they get
evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
my friends keep askin' me why i can't just walk away from
i'm addicted to the pain the stress the drama
i'm drawn to shit i guess i'm a
mess cursed and blessed but this time i
ain't changin' my mind i'm climbin' out this abyss
you're screamin' as i walk out that i'll be missed
but when you spoke of people
who meant the most to you you left me off your list
fuck you hiphop i'm leavin' you
my life sentence is served bitch and it's justâ€¦

too late for the other side
caught in a chase 25 to life
i'm gone man
too late for the other side
caught in a chase 25 to life
too late
caught in a chase 25 to life
